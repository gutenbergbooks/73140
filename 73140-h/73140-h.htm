<p>The perusal of the constructive treatises
of the foremost leaders of the different
religions should help to promote at least
more mutual respect, if not, indeed, actual
co-operation, among their devotees than
the study of the critical discussions of
lesser minds. For this reason the present
small volume of extracts from the chief
constructive work of Al Ghazzali has been
included in the Gaekwad Studies in Religion
and Philosophy. The purpose of
that series is to be constructive rather
than critical, and further, it is meant to
contain volumes appealing to the general
public as well as to the scholar. For a
wider and more correct understanding
and appreciation of the spirit of Islam, it
is to be regretted that there are so few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
English translations of Muslim works
in Arabic and Persian. It is to be hoped
that in future more attention will be turned
in this direction. In the meantime
the present volume may serve at least to
arouse some interest.</p>

<p>This work was undertaken at the request
of Professor Widgery, to whom I
am indebted for several suggestions
and for going through the whole of the
manuscript and the proofs.</p>

</div>

<p>The Comparative Study of Religions,
interesting as a form of intellectual
research, has for many a further value
in the influence it may exert upon the
widening and the deepening of the religious
life. The practical value may become
more and more acknowledged, if, as signs
suggest, the reality of the religious experience
is more keenly felt and mankind
recognise the place of religious goods in the
highest type of life. Though it is certainly
premature to say that there is much
serious acknowledgement and recognition
of these values amongst the peoples
of the world, there are reasons to think
that tendencies of thought and feeling in
this direction are increasing in power.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
One of the best means of aiding the
Comparative Study of Religions and
promoting these tendencies is by the
publication of important books connected
with the religions, representing the views
of leading thinkers and saints.</p>

<p>If we turn to Islam, we find that some
Western writers describe it as in a
condition of progressive decay, while others
would have us believe that its onward
march is a menace. It is well to be able to
avoid the obvious purpose which lies behind
both contentions. Nevertheless, to the
present writer it appears true to say that
there is much stagnation in Islam (In which
religion is there not?), and that its spirit is
often lost and its real teachings neglected
owing to the general use of Arabic
in the recitation of the Quran by persons
entirely ignorant of that language, and also
to the prevalent mechanical conception
of the character of the Quran as a form
of divine revelation. We believe that the
Comparative Study of Religions will help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
to turn the attention of Muslims away from
these to the emphasising of the essential
spirit of Islam. This should be central and
normative in the rising movements of reform
and rejuvenescence. In this connection,
as bringing out this spirit, it is especially
appropriate, both for the students of the
religions and for those directly interested
in the spiritual revival in Islam, to publish
in an easily accessible form some of the religious
and moral teachings of Ghazzali. A
Western scholar has written of him that
he is “the greatest, certainly the most
sympathetic figure in the history of Islam ... the
only teacher of the after generations
ever put by Muslims on a level with
the four great Imams.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And he goes
on to remark further; “In the renaissance of
Islam which is now rising to view, his time
will come and the new life will proceed
from a renewed study of his works.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But
Dieterici says of him: “As a despairing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
sceptic he springs suicidally into the
all-God (<i>i.e.</i> all-pervading deity of the
Pantheists) to kill all scientific reflection.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
To justify such a judgment would indeed be
impossible if the whole course of Ghazzali’s
works is taken into consideration. The
greatest eulogy is perhaps that of Tholuck:
“All that is good, worthy, and sublime,
which his great soul had compassed, he
bestowed upon Muhammedanism, and he
adorned the doctrines of the Quran with
so much piety and learning that in the form
given them by him they seem, in my opinion,
worthy of the assent of Christians.
Whatsoever was most excellent in the
philosophy of Aristotle or in the Sufi
mysticism, he discreetly adapted to the
Muhammedan theology. From every school
he sought the means of shedding light and
honour upon religion, while his sincere
piety and lofty conscientiousness imparted
to all his writings a sacred majesty.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>One feature of Ghazzali’s attitude has
considerable significance in looking to an
increased study of his works as a factor
towards the revivification of Islam: his
tolerance. Although regarding Al
Hallaj’s expressions, (for example, I am
the truth, <i>i.e.</i> God) as incautious, he
helped to defend him and to save him
from execution on a charge of blasphemy.
He wrote a treatise on tolerance: <i>The
Criterion of the Difference between Islam
and Heresy</i>. In this teaching of tolerance
he felt himself to be pointing back to the
policy of the earliest Muslim times and
to the greatest authorities of early Islam.
He “strove to attract the souls of his
fellow Muslims to spiritual faith which
unifies, to worship at the altars which are
in the hearts of men”.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The influence of Ghazzali has been
represented by Mr. Macdonald as chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
that he led men back from scholastic
labours upon theological dogmas to living
contact with, study and exegesis of the
Quran and Traditions; gave Sufiism an
assured position within the Church of
Islam; and brought philosophy and philosophical
theology within the range of the
ordinary mind.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Al Ghazzali has given some account of
his own religious development in a work
entitled: <i>Munqidh min-ad-dalal</i>. This
account is significant, but as the Baron
Carra de Vaux remarks, his eventual explicit
adoption of a Sufi mysticism was not
merely a consequence of the failure of his
other attempts to find a solution to life’s
profoundest problems but a result of his
early influences. For, soon after his birth
at Tus in Khorassan in 450 A.H. (1059
A.D.), his father died and he was
brought up by a Sufi. Nevertheless his
mystical leanings did not assert themselves
vigorously till he was well on to maturity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Up to that time he devoted himself to the
usual studies of canon law, the orthodox
theology, the doctrines of the Mutazillites,
and a variety of other subjects including
the works of the Sufis. For a time he
was a student of the Asharite Imam Al
Haramayn at Nysabur. He himself
represents his attitude as at this time
that of one working and wishing for
reputation and wealth. In 484 A.H.
he was honoured by appointment to the
“University” or “Academy” of Baghdad,
where he soon acquired great renown as
lawyer and theologian.</p>

<p>On the threshold of maturity he was
afflicted by doubts as to the validity and
worth of the theological and philosophical
bases of his religious belief. The strain
of his reflection and the intensity of his
anxiety to reach a secure faith seem to
have caused a breakdown of health. With
unexpected suddenness he left Baghdad.
That was in 488 A.H. (1095 A.D.) He
had examined in all details the traditional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
orthodox scholastic system of the <i>Kalam</i>,
the positions of the Mutazilites and the
philosophers, and in the light of his new
doubts and experiences turned again also
to a closer study of the writings of the
leading mystics, such as Abu Talib, Al
Muhasibi, and Al Junayd. His early
training had predisposed him to the acceptance
of mysticism, and this acceptance
was led up to by the conclusions of his
reflection, in which it has been maintained
he carried doubt as far back as did
Descartes.</p>

<p>Thus he himself writes: “A
thirst to comprehend the essential natures
of all things was, indeed, my idiosyncrasy
and distinctive characteristic from the
beginning of my career and prime of my
life: a natural gift and temperament
bestowed on me by God, and implanted
by Him in my nature by no choice or device
of my own, till at length the bond of blind
conformity was loosed from me, and the
beliefs which I had inherited, were broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
away when I was little more than a boy.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Carra de Vaux<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> thus graphically
describes the process in Al Ghazzali’s
mind, as he himself suggests it to
us: “Religious beliefs, he reflected, are
transmitted by the authority of parents;
but authority is not proof. To arrive at
certitude it was necessary for him to reconstruct
all his knowledge from the very
foundation. With a vivid feeling of this
necessity, he aspired to certitude, defining
it in a purely psychological fashion as a
state in which the mind is so bound up
with and so satisfied with a piece of knowledge
that nothing might henceforth
deprive him of it. This curious definition,
which is applied to religious faith
as well as to scientific knowledge, does
not escape from being purely subjective.
As one might foresee, the great desire for
certitude only led him at first into a
series of doubts. As he sought this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
state of perfect assurance, step by step he
saw it recede before him. He looked for
certitude in the perceptions of the senses,
with the result that he could no longer
trust his senses. Sight, the most powerful
of the faculties of sense, for example, led
him to the perception of an immovable
shadow on the sun and an hour afterwards
this shadow was gone. Sight showed
him a star which is very small, and
geometry made him recognise it to be
greater than the earth. Then he turned
to the first principles of reason; but the
perception of the senses took its revenge
in saying to him: ‘Previously you believed
in me and you abandoned me when
this judge reason presented itself. If
this judge had remained hidden you would
have continued to believe in me. Who can
tell you that beyond the reason there is
no other judge, which if it made itself
evident, would convict reason of falsehood?’.
That is a movement of thought
which is dramatic enough, though perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
a little artificial.—The thinker continued
his search for the certain. He halted and
concerned himself with the famous comparison
of life with a dream and death
with an awakening. Perhaps after that
awakening he would see things in a different
manner from that in which he then
saw them. Mysticism thus suggested
itself to him: This actual dream of death
could be anticipated by the condition of
ecstasy, by less than ecstasy, by a light
which God pours into the heart. In this
light, he saw not only the truth of the
dogmas of the faith or the beauty of the
moral life, but he was assured of the truth
of the first principles of reason, the basis
of all knowledge and all reasoning. He
doubted no longer; he was cured of his
pains; he had found certitude and peace.”</p>

<p>On leaving Baghdad, he retired to
meditate in the mosques of Damascus,
and is further reported to have made
pilgrimages to Jerusalem, Hebron (the
burial place of Abraham), Medina and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Mecca. In abandonment to his immediate
religious experience of the love of God he
found more peace. In the course of time
he associated again more definitely with
his family. Eventually in 499 A. H.
(1106 A.D.) he was ordered by the
Sultan to teach in the Academy at
Nysabur. After a life in which he had
written a large number of independent
treatises and indeed brought about a great
change in the tendencies of Islam, he
died at his native town of Tus in 505
(1111 A.D.).</p>

<p>If in his initial process of doubt
Ghazzali resembled Descartes, in his view
of causality he reminds us of Hume; in his
general attitude he approaches Kant and
Schleiermacher. On the one hand he
insists on the limitation of the efficiency of
the theoretical reason, on the other he
finds in will, in the moral and the religious
experience a more immediate avenue
to real knowledge. For the study of
religion in our day it is important to note<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
that Ghazzali (here unlike Kant) sees in
religious experience a way to certitude.
But in this he is led to acknowledge that
the advance of the human mind towards
its goal of real knowledge and peace is
dependent upon an active influence of God
upon man. It may be maintained that he
puts here in religious terminology the central
idea of the Aristotelian conception of
Scholastic times, the relation of the
“Active Intelligence” to the minds of
men. His view enabled him to give a
due position to the Prophet and the Quran.
For the knowledge of God is to be conceived
as coming not in immediate mystical
intuition to all alike, but while in some
degree to all, to some in a special degree.
These are the prophets. The position
which Maimonides presents in his <i>Guide
to the Perplexed</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> with relation to religious
knowledge and the functions of the prophets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
is parallel with that of Ghazzali.</p>

<p>From the accompanying list and classification
of the works of Ghazzali, it will
be seen that he was a writer on all sides
of the theory and practice of his religion.
He was an authority on canon law and
jurisprudence, and a commentator of the
Quran. He examined the positions of the
Scholastic theologians, and found that
they depended entirely on the acceptance
of their initial dogmatic assumptions. The
disputes of the Scholastics amongst themselves
appeared to have little or no relation
with religious life, rather if anything
they were a hindrance to true religion.
And in face of the philosophers the Scholastic
theologians were almost helpless.
But the books which exerted the greatest
influence both within and beyond Muslim
circles, and the books that still retain their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
interest today are the Maqasid ul Falasafa
(The Aim or Goal of the Philosophers)
the Tahafat ul Falasafa (the Refutation of
the Philosophers) and the Ihya-u-Ulum-id-Din
(The Renovation of the Sciences of
Religion.) In the first of these he gives
an account of the different philosophical
positions which were more or less prevalent.
In the second he critically examines those
positions. In the third he gives a general
survey with a constructive purpose
chiefly moral and religious. It is due to
this last work more than all others that
Ghazzali has been called “The Regenerator
of Religion”, “The Proof of Islam”. The
<i>Ihya</i> “expounds theology and ethics from
the moderate Sufi school”. Though it was
committed to the flames, chiefly in Spain,
probably by those holding opinions which
Ghazzali had bitterly attacked, it soon
established its position in the Muslim world,
in which it has been widely studied up to
today. From it the passages translated in
this book are taken. The following table<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>

<p>Against the philosophers he argued
for the belief in the reality of the divine
attributes and against the view of the
eternity of the world. He contended against
the theory that there would be no physical
punishments and rewards hereafter,
maintaining, as he did, the doctrine of the
resurrection of the body. He virtually
denied that there is real causal connection
in events as experienced by us: but only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
sequence: in this he adumbrates the theory
of Hume. For Ghazzali, God is the only
efficient cause. From the scepticism to
which his consideration of philosophy led
him he turned to the acceptance of
revelation, this as found in the mystic
experience and in the words of saints and
prophets, especially the Prophet
Muhammed.</p>

<p>The knowledge of moral principles
Ghazzali conceived as coming not through
rational reflection but by immediate intuition
of the divine character revealing itself.
Moral truths come especially through
moral and religious teachers, as the most
fit persons for the transmission of these
revelations. He possessed great skill in
psychological analysis of moral conditions,
and passages in illustration of this have
been included here, treating of pride and
vanity, friendship and sincerity. As almost
all great practical moral and religious
teachers, Ghazzali makes considerable use
of apt stories, and of striking sayings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
from the saints and prophets. He continually
harks back to the time of the Prophet
and his “Companions”.</p>

<p>Ghazzali’s abandonment of his academic
position at Baghdad, his retirement
to mosques and journeyings on pilgrimage,
are sufficient evidence that he recognised
that the truth of mysticism could not be
tested by theoretical reflection but only
by an attempt at practice. Only the experience
itself could prove its own reality. He
appears to have held that for the attainment
of the condition of ecstasy the means of
asceticism and meditation should be used.
But it does not seem quite correct to suggest
as does Carra de Vaux that Ghazzali
did not recognise the fact of divine “grace”,
though he did not use a corresponding
term. The beatific vision of the mystic
certainly depended in part, for Ghazzali,
on God’s mercy in removing the veil.
How far he himself was successful in
attaining the bliss of the mystic vision
it is impossible to tell: in this direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
he gained no such reputation as did
several other Sufis. He taught that repentance,
a moral conversion, is a necessary
preliminary to the mystic life, and he fought
against a common tendency of mystics
towards antinomianism. Similarly he tried
to avoid the danger of interpreting the
union of the soul with God as its identification
with God in a pantheistic view of the
universe. Goldzieher says he differed from
the Sufis generally in the rejection of
their pantheistic aims and low estimate
of religious ordinances.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h1>MORAL AND RELIGIOUS<br>
TEACHINGS OF AL GHAZZALI</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NATURE_OF_MAN">THE NATURE OF MAN<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></h2>

</div>

<p>Though man shares with the other
animals external and internal senses,
he is at the same time also endowed
with two qualities peculiar to himself,
knowledge and will. By knowledge is meant
the power of generalisation, the conception
of abstract ideas, and the possession of
intellectual truths. By will is meant that
strong desire to acquire an object which
after due consideration of its consequences
has been pronounced by reason to be good.
It is quite different from animal desire,
nay, it is often the very opposite of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>In the beginning children also lack these
two qualities. They have passion, anger,
and all the external and internal
senses, but will finds its expression only
later. Knowledge differs according to the
capacity for it, according to the latent
powers in a man. Hence there is a
variety of stages amongst Prophets,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the
Ulamas, the Sufis and the Philosophers.
Further progress is possible even
beyond these stages, for divine knowledge
knows no bounds. The highest stage is
reached by one to whom all truths and
realities are revealed intuitively, who by
virtue of his exalted position enjoys direct
communion and close relation with the
Most Holy. The real nature of this position
is known only to him who enjoys it.
We verify it by faith. A child has no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
knowledge of the attainments of an adult;
an adult is not aware of the acquisitions
of a learned man. Similarly, a learned
man is not cogniscant of the holy communion
of the saints and the prophets, and
of the favours bestowed on them. Although
the divine blessings descend freely, those
are fit recipients of them, whose hearts
are pure and wholly devoted to Him.
“Verily,” says the Hadis,
“the desire of the
virtuous is to hold communion with me,
and I long to look at them”. “He who
approaches me a span, I approach him
an arm”.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The divine favours are not withheld,
but hearts bedimmed by impurity
fail to receive them. “Had it not been
that the devils hover round the hearts of
men, they would have seen the glories of
the Kingdom of the Heaven”.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The superiority of man consists thus
in his being cogniscant
of divine attributes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and actions. Therein lies his perfection;
thus he may be worthy of admission to
God’s presence.</p>

<p>The body serves as a vehicle for the
soul, and the soul is the abode for knowledge
which is its fundamental character
as well as its ultimate object. The horse
and the ass are both beasts of burden, but
a superiority of the former is found in its
being gracefully adapted for use in battle.
If the horse fails in this it is degraded to
the rank of mere burden bearing animals.
Similarly with man. In certain qualities
man resembles a horse and an ass, but his
distinguishing trait is his participation in
the nature of the angels, for he holds a
middle position between the beast and the
angel. Considering the mode of his
nourishment and growth he is found to
belong to the vegetable world. Considering
his power of movement and impulses he is
a denizen of the animal kingdom. The
distinguishing quality of knowledge lifts
him up to the celestial world. If he fails<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
to develop this quality and to translate
it into action he is no better than a grunting
pig, a snarling dog, a prowling wolf,
or a crafty fox.</p>

<p>If he wishes for true happiness, let
him look upon reason as a monarch sitting
on the throne of his heart, imagination as
its ambassador, memory as treasurer, speech
as interpreter, the limbs as clerks, and the
senses as spies in the realms of colour,
sound, smell, etc. If all these properly
discharge the duties allotted to them, if
every faculty does that for which it was
created—and such service is the real meaning
of thanksgiving to God—the ultimate object
of his sojourn in this transitory world
is realised.</p>

<p>Man’s nature is made up of four elements,
which produce in him four attributes,
namely, the beastly; the brutal, the satanic,
and the divine. In man there is something
of the pig, the dog, the devil, and the
saint. The pig is the appetite which is
repulsive not for its form but for its lust<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
and its gluttony. The dog is passion
which barks and bites, causing injury to
others. The devil is the attribute which
instigates these former two, embellishing
them and bedimming the sight of reason
which is the divine attribute. Divine
reason, if properly attended to, would repel
the evil by exposing its character. It
would properly control appetite and the
passions. But when a man fails to obey
the dictates of reason, these three other
attributes prevail over him and cause his
ruin. Such types of men are many. What
a pity it is that these who would find fault
with those who worship stones do not see
that on their part they worship the pig
and the dog in themselves: Let them be
ashamed of their deplorable condition and
leave no stone unturned for the suppression
of these evil attributes. The pig of
appetite begets shamelessness, lust, slander,
and such like; the dog of passion begets
pride, vanity, ridicule, wrath and tyranny.
These two, controlled by the satanic power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
produce deceit, treachery, perfidy, meanness
etc. but if divinity in man is uppermost
the qualities of knowledge, wisdom, faith,
and truth, etc. will be acquired.</p>

<p>Know then that mind is like a mirror
which reflects images. But just as the
mirror, the image, and the mode of reflection
are three different things so mind,
objects, and the way of knowing are also
distinct. There are five reasons which
may prevent the object from being reflected
in the mirror. 1. There may be something
wrong with the mirror. 2. Something
other than the mirror may prevent the
reflection. 3. The object may not be in
front of it. 4. Something may come between
the object and the mirror. 5. The
position of the object may not be known,
so that the mirror may be properly placed.
Similarly, for five reasons, the mind fails
to receive knowledge. 1. The mind may be
imperfect, like the child’s. 2. Sin and
guilt may bedim the mind and throw a
veil over it. 3. The mind may be diverted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
from the real object. For example, a man
may be obedient and good, but instead of
rising higher to the acquisition of truth
and contemplation of God is contented
with bodily devotions and acquirement of
means of living. Such a mind, though
pure, will not reflect the divine image for
his objects of thought are other than this.
If this is the condition of such mind, think
what will be the state of those minds
which are absorbed in the gratification of
their inordinate passions. 4. An external
screen, may as it were, come before the
objects. Sometimes a man who has subjugated
his passions still through blind
imitation or prejudice fails to know the
truth. Such types are found amongst
the votaries of the Kalam. Even
many virtuous men also fall a prey to it
and blindly stick to their dogmas. 5. There
may be ignorance of the means for the
acquisition of truth. Thus for illustration,
a man wants to see his back in a mirror:
if he places the mirror before his eyes he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
fails to see his back; if he keeps it facing
his back it will still be out of sight. Let
him then take another mirror and place
one before his eyes and the other facing
his back in such a position that the image
of the latter is reflected in the former.
Thus he will be able to see his back. Similarly
the knowledge of the proper means
is a key to the knowledge of the unknown
from the known.</p>

<p>The divine dispensation is liberal in the
distribution of its bounties, but for reasons
mentioned above, minds fail to profit by
them. For human minds partake of the
nature of the divine and the capacity to
apprehend truth is innate. The Quran
says: “Surely we offered the trust to the
heavens and the earth and the mountains,
but they declined to bear it up and were
afraid of it and man took it up. Surely
he is not just (to himself) and is ignorant”.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
In this passage the innate capacity of man
is hinted at and refers to the secret power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of knowing God, latent in human minds by
virtue of which they have preference over
other objects and the universe. The Prophet
says: “Every child is born in the right
state (Fitrat) but his parents make him a
Jew, a Christian, or a Magian.” And again:
“Had it not been that evil spirits hover
round the hearts of the sons of Adam they
would have seen the kingdom of heaven”.
Ibn Umar reports that the Prophet was
once asked as to where God is found either
on earth or in heaven. “He is in the
hearts of his faithful servants”, replied the
Prophet.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place to throw
some light here on the following terms
which are often vaguely applied while
dealing with the question of human nature.</p>

<p>1. Qalb (heart) has two meanings. (<i>a</i>)
a conical shaped piece of flesh on the left
side of the chest, circulating blood, the
source of animal spirits. It is found in all
animals. The heart thus belongs to the
external world and can be seen with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
material eyes. (<i>b</i>) A mysterious divine
substance which is related to the material
heart like the relation between the dweller
and the house or the artisan and his implements.
It alone is sentient and responsible.</p>

<p>2. Ruh (spirit) means (<i>a</i>) a vapoury
substance which, issues from the material
heart, and quickens every part of the body.
It is like a lamp which is placed in a
house and sheds its light on all sides. (<i>b</i>)
The soul which is expressed in the Quran
as ‘divine commandment’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and is used in
the same sense as the second meaning of
Qalb, mentioned above.</p>

<p>3. Nafs (self) which means (<i>a</i>) the
substratum for appetite and passion. The
Sufis call it the embodiment of vices. (<i>b</i>)
The ego which receives different names in
accordance with the qualities acquired
from changes in its conditions. When in
subjugating passions it acquires mastery
over them and feels undisturbed, it is called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
<i>the peaceful self</i> (Nafsi mutmainna).
The Quran says: “Nafs that art at rest.
Return to thy Lord well pleased with
Him, well pleasing.” When it upbraids
man for his actions it is called <i>conscience</i>
(Nafsi lauwama). When it freely indulges
in the gratification of his passions, it is
called <i>the inordinate self</i> (Nafsi ammara).</p>

</div>

<p>Actions are either voluntary or involuntary.
The difference between them is
not of kind but of degree. Analyse the
process of an involuntary action and
you will find that if, for example, a man
intends to thrust a needle in your eye or
draws a sword to strike on your head, your
eye in the former case will at once close
and in the latter your hand will suddenly
be raised up to shield your head. This
prompt action on the part of your eye and
hand is due to your consciousness of the
evil to be evaded, and this gives rise to
volition which moves the eye and the
hand without the least delay. There are,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
however, cases the desirability or rejection
of which needs meditation, but the moment
mind decides, the decision is carried out as
promptly as in the above example. This
meditation translated into choice or
rejection constitutes will. Now will makes
its choice between two alternatives and
takes its cue either from imagination or
reason. For example, a man may be
unable to cut his own throat, not because
his hand is weak or a knife is not available,
but because will is lacking which
would give the stimulus to suicide. For
man loves his own life. But suppose he
gets tired of his life, owing to having harrowing
pains and unbearable mental sufferings.
He has now to choose between two
alternatives which are both undesirable. A
struggle commences and he hangs between
life and death. If he thinks that death
which will put an end to his sufferings
quickly is preferable to life with its lingering
intolerable pains, he will choose death
although he loves his life. This choice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
gives rise to will, the command to which,
communicated through proper channels,
would then be faithfully executed by his
hand in the manner of suicide. Thus,
though the process from the commencement
of mental struggle for the choice
between too alternatives down to the
stimulus to physical action is uniformly
determinate there is at any rate a sort of
freedom traceable in the will.</p>

<p>Man holds the balance between determinism
and freedom. The uniform succession
of events is on the lines of determination
but his choice which is an essential
element of will is his own. Our Ulamas
have therefore coined a separate phrase:
<i>Kasb</i> (acquisition), distinguishing it from
<i>Jabr</i> (necessity) and <i>Ikhtiyar</i> (freedom)
They say that fire burns of necessity (Jabr)
but man may acquire fire through the
appropriate methods, while in Almighty
God is the ultimate cause of fire (<i>Ikhtiyar</i>).
But it must be noted that when we use the
word Ikhtiyar for God, we must exclude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the notion of choice, which is an essential
element of will in man. Let it be here
recognised once for all as a general principle
that all the words of man’s vocabulary
when used for God’s attributes are similarly
metaphorical.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>The question may be asked: If God
is the ultimate cause why should there be
a causal connection in the orderly succession
of events? The answer to this lies in
the correct understanding of the nature of
causation. Nothing causes anything.
Antecedents have consequents.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> God alone
is the efficient cause, but the ignorant have
misunderstood and misapplied the word
<i>power</i>. As to the orderly succession of
events, let it be understood that the two
events are conjoined like the relation between
the condition and the conditioned.
Now certain conditions are very apparent
and can be known easily by people of little
understanding, but there are conditions
which are understood only by those who
see through the light of intuition: hence
the common error of miscalculating the
uniformity of events. There is a divine
purpose linking the antecedents to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
consequents and manifesting itself in the
existing orderly succession of events,
without the least break or irregularity.
“Verily”, says the Quran. “We did not
create the heavens and the earth and what
is between them in sport. We did not
create them both but with truth, but most
of them do not know”.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Surely, there is a set purpose pervading
the universe. The uniform succession of
events is not at random. There is no such
thing as chance. Here again it may be
asked: If God is the efficient cause, how
will you account for actions attributed
to man in the scriptures? Are we to
believe that there are two causes for one
effect? My answer to this will be that
the word cause is vaguely understood. It
can be used in two different senses. Just
as we say that the death of A was caused
by (1) B. the executioner, and (2) C the
king’s order. Both these statements are
correct. Similarly God is the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
actions as He has creative power and efficiency.
At the same time man is the cause
of actions as he is the source of the manifestation
of uniform succession of events.
In the former case we have a real causal
connection, while in the latter a relation
of the antecedent to the consequent after
the manner of the connection between the
condition and the conditioned. There are
passages in the Quran where the word
cause is used in different senses.</p>

<p>“The angel of death who is given
charge of you shall cause you to die: then
to your Lord you shall be brought back”.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
“Allah takes the souls at the time of
their death”.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>“Have you considered what you sow?”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
“We pour down the water, pouring it down
in abundance. Then we cleave the earth;
cleaving it asunder. Then we cause to
grow therein the grain”.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>“Fight them: Allah will chastise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
them by your hands and bring them to
disgrace”.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> “So you did not slay them,
but it was Allah who slew them, and thou
didst not smite when thou didst smite, but
it was Allah who smote, that he might
confer upon the believers a good gift from
himself”.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>These passages show that the word,
cause, signifies creative power, and must
be applied to God alone. But as man’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
power is the image of God’s power the
word was applied to him figuratively. Yet,
just as the death of a culprit is caused by
the actual killing by the hand of the executioner
and not the king’s order, so the word
cause actually applied to man is contrary
to fact. God alone is the real efficient
cause, and the word must be applied to
him in its root sense of power.</p>

<p>It may be asked then, why man should
be rewarded for his good actions and punished
for his misdeeds. Let us consider
first the nature of reward and punishment.
Experience tells us that things have natural
properties and that physical laws operate in
a uniform manner. Take, for example, the
science of medicine. Certain drugs are
found to possess certain qualities. If a
man swallows poison of his own accord he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
has no right to ask why poison kills him.
Its natural property has simply operated
in his system and caused his death. Similarly
actions make an impression on mind.
Good and bad actions are invariably followed
by pleasure and pain respectively. A
good action is its own reward of pleasure
and a bad one of pain. The former works
like an elixir; the latter like poison. The
properties of actions have been discovered,
like discoveries in medicine, but by the
physicians of the heart, the saints and the
prophets. If you will not listen to them
you must suffer the consequence. Now
hear a parable:</p>

<p>A certain king sent a horse, a robe of
honour, and travelling expenses to one of
his suzerains in a distant land. Although
the king had no need of his services, the
royal gift was a favour shown to his suzerain,
so that he might come to the king’s
court and be happy in his presence. If
the suzerain understands the king’s intention
from the nature of the gift and utilizes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
it properly with a grateful heart, he will
wait on the king and live happily, but if he
misuses the gift or takes no heed of it, he
will prove an ungrateful wretch.</p>

<p>It is thus that the boundless mercy of
the omnipotent and omniscient God
bestowed on us the gift of life, providing
us with bodily organs, mental and moral
faculties, so that we uplift ourselves by
utilizing them properly, and be worthy of
being admitted into his holy presence. If
we misuse them or pay no regard to them,
surely we shall be (Kafirs) (literally “ungrateful”)
for his blessings bestowed on us
for our good, and thus be doomed.</p>

<p>“Verily,” says the Quran, “we created
man in the best make. Then we render
him the lowest of the low. Except those
who believe and do good, so they shall
have a reward never to be cut off”.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<h3><i>The Allegory of the Pen</i></h3>

<p>A certain devotee who was on the way
to illumination saw a piece of paper with
lines written on it. “Why”, said the devotee,
“hast thou blackened thy bright face?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
“It is not fair to take me to task”, replied
the paper, “I have done nothing. Ask
the ink why she has sallied forth from the
inkstand where she was quite at ease, and
forcibly blackened my face”. “You are
right” said the devotee. Then he turned to
the ink and enquired of her. “Why do you
ask me”, she said, “I was sitting still in
the inkstand and had no mind to come out
but this truculent pen rushed at me, drew
me out and scattered me over the page.
There you see me lying helpless, go to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
pen and ask him”. The devotee turned to
the pen and interrogated him about his
high-handedness. “Why do you trouble
me”, answered the pen, “Look, what am I?
an insignificant reed. I was growing by
the banks of silvery streams amidst shady
green trees, when lo: a hand stretched at
me. It held a knife, which uprooted me,
flayed me and separated my joints, hewed
me, cleaved my head then, chopped it off.
I was sent headlong towards the ink, and
have to serve abjectly. Do not add insult
to my injuries, go to the hand and ask
him”. The devotee looked at the hand
and said: “Is it true? Are you so cruel?”
“Do not be angry, Sir” replied the hand
“I am a bundle of flesh, bones, and blood.
Have you ever seen a piece of flesh exerting
power? Can a body move of itself? I am a
vehicle used by one called vitality. He
rides on me and forces me round and round.
You see, a dead man has hands but cannot
use them because vitality has left them.
Why should I, a mere vehicle, be blamed?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Go to vitality and ask him why he makes
use of me.” “You are right”, said the
devotee, and then questioned vitality. “Do
not find fault with me”, answered vitality,
“Many a time a censurer himself is reproved,
while the censured is found faultless. How
do you know that I have forced the hand?
I was already there before he moved, and
had no idea of the motion. I was
unconscious and the on-lookers were also
unaware of me. Suddenly an agent came
and stirred me. I had neither strength
enough to disobey nor willingness to
obey him. That for which you would
take me to task I had to do according to
his wish, I do not know who this agent is.
He is called will and I know him by
name only. Had the matter been left
to me I think I should have done nothing.”
“All right”, continued the devotee, “I
shall put the question to will, and ask
him why he has forcibly employed vitality
which of its own accord would have done
nothing”. “Do not be in too great a hurry”,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
exclaimed will, “perchance I may give you
sufficient reason. His majesty, the mind,
sent an ambassador, named knowledge, who
delivered his message to me through
reason, saying: ‘Rise up, stir vitality’. I
was forced to do so, because I have
to obey knowledge and reason, but I know
not why. As long as I receive no order I
am happy, but the moment an order is
delivered I dare not disobey. Whether my
monarch be a just ruler or a tyrant, I
must obey him. On my oath, as long as the
king hesitates or ponders over the matter
I stand quiet, ready to serve, but the
moment his order is passed my sense of
obedience which is innate forces me to
stir up vitality. So, you should not blame
me. Go to knowledge and get information
there”. “You are right,” consented the
devotee, and proceeding, asked mind and
its ambassador, knowledge and reason, for
an explanation. Reason excused himself by
saying he was a lamp only, but knew not
who had lighted it. Mind pleaded his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
innocence by calling himself a mere <i>tabula
rasa</i>. Knowledge maintained that it was
simply an inscription on the <i>tabula rasa</i>,
inscribed after the lamp of reason had
been lighted. Thus he could not be
considered the author of the inscription
which may have been the work
of some invisible pen. The devotee was
puzzled by the reply, but collecting
himself, he spoke thus to knowledge: “I
am wandering in the path of my enquiry.
To whomsoever I go and ask the reason I
am referred to another. Nevertheless, there
is pleasure in my quest, for I find that
everyone gives me a plausible reason. But
pardon me, Sir if I say that your reply,
knowledge, fails to satisfy me. You say
that you are a mere inscription recorded
by a pen. I have seen pen, ink, and tablet.
They are of reed, a black mixture, and of
wood and iron, respectively. And I have
seen lamps lighted with fire. But here I do
not see any of these things, and yet you
talk of the tablet, the lamp, the pen and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the inscription. Surely you are not trifling
with me?” “Certainly not”, returned
knowledge, “I spoke in right earnest. But
I see your difficulty. Your means are
scanty, your horse is jaded, and your
journey is long and dangerous. Give up
this enterprise, as I fear you cannot succeed.
If, however you are prepared to run
the risk, then listen. Your journey extends
through three regions. The first is the
terrestrial world. Its objects pen, ink,
paper, hand etc. are just what you have
seen them to be. The second is the celestial
world, which will begin when you have
left me behind. There you will come across
dense forests, deep wide rivers and high
impassable mountains and I know not how
you would be able to proceed. Between
these two worlds there is a third
intermediary region called the phenomenal
world. You have crossed three stages of it,
vitality, will, and knowledge. To use a
simile: a man who is walking is treading
the terrestrial world: if he is sailing in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
boat he enters the phenomenal world: if
he leaves the boat and swims and walks on
the waters, he is admitted in the celestial
world. If you do not know how to swim,
go back. For, the watery region of the
celestial world begins now when you can
see that pen inscribing on the tablet of the
heart. If you are not of whom it was said:
‘O ye of little faith, wherefore didst thou
doubt?’<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> prepare thyself. For, by faith you
shall not simply walk on the sea but fly in
the air”. The wondering devotee stood
speechless for awhile, then turning to
knowledge, began: “I am in a difficulty.
The dangers of the path which you have
described unnerve my heart, and I know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
not whether I have sufficient strength to
face them and to succeed in the end”.
“There is a test for your strength”, replied
knowledge, “Open your eyes and fix your
gaze on me. If you see the pen which writes
on the heart, you will in my opinion, be able
to proceed further on. For he who crosses
the phenomenal world, knocks at the door
of the celestial world, then sights the pen
which writes on hearts”. The devotee did
as he was advised, but failed to see that
pen, because his notion of pen was no other
but of a pen of reed or wood. Then
knowledge drew his attention, saying:
“There’s the rub. Do you not know that
the furniture of a palace indicates the status
of its lord? Nothing in the universe
resembles God,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> therefore his attributes
are also transcendental. He is neither body
nor is in space. His hand is not a bundle
of flesh, bone, and blood. His pen is not
of reed or wood. His writing is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
from ink prepared from vitriol and gall.
But there are many who ignorantly cling
to an anthropomorphic view of Him, there
are few who cherish a transcendentally pure
conception of Him, and believe that He is
not only above all material limitation
but even above the limitation of metaphor.
You seem to be oscillating between these
two views, because on the one hand you
think that God is immaterial, that His
words have neither sound nor shape; on the
other hand you cannot rise to the
transcendental conception of His hand,
pen and tablet. Do you think that the
meaning of the tradition “Verily God
created Adam in His own image”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is limited
to the visible face of man? Certainly not:
it is the inward nature of man seen by the
inward sight which can be called the image
of God. But listen: You are now at the
sacred mount, where the invisible voice from
the burning bush speaks: “I am that I am;”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
“Verily I am thy Lord God, put off thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
shoes”.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The devotee, who listening with
rapture, suddenly saw as it were a flash
of lightning, there appeared working the
pen which writes on hearts-formless. “A
thousand blessings on thee, O knowledge,
who hast saved me from falling into the
abysm of anthropomorphism (Tashbih).
I thank thee from the bottom of my
heart. I tarried long, but now, adieu”.</p>

<p>The devotee then resumed his journey.
Halting in the presence of the invisible
pen, politely he asked the same question.
“You know my reply” answered the
mysterious pen, “You cannot have forgotten
the reply given to you by the pen in the
terrestrial world”. “Yes, I remember,”
replied the devotee, “but how can it be
the same reply, because there is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
similitude between you and that pen”.
“Then it seems you have forgotten the
tradition: Verily God created Adam in
his own image”. “No, Sir”, interrupted
the devotee, “I know it by heart”. “And
you have forgotten also that passage in
the Quran: “And the heavens rolled
up in his right hand.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> “Certainly not”,
exclaimed the devotee, “I can repeat the
whole of the Quran by rote”. “Yes, I
know, and as you are now treading the
sacred precincts of the celestial world
I think I can now safely tell you that
you have simply learnt the meaning of these
passages from a negative point of view.
But they have a positive value, and should
be utilised as constructive at this stage.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Proceed further and you will understand
what I mean”. The devotee looked and
found himself reflecting upon the divine
attribute omnipotence. At once he
realised the force of the mysterious
pen’s argument, but goaded by his
inquisitive nature he was about to put the
question to the holy being, when a
voice like the deafening sound of thunder
was heard from above, proclaiming: “He
is not questioned for his actions but they
shall be asked”. Filled with surprize; the
devotee bent his head in silent submission.</p>

<p>The hand of the divine mercy stretched
towards the helpless devotee; into his
ear were whispered in zephyr tones:
“Verily those who strive in our way we
will certainly show them the path which
leads to us”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. Opening his eyes, the devotee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
raised his head and poured forth his heart
in silent prayer. “Holy art thou, O God
Almighty: blessed is thy name O Lord
of the universe. Henceforth I shall fear no
mortal: I put my entire trust in thee:
thy forgiveness is my solace: thy mercy
is my refuge.”</p>

<p>(Light may be thrown on the matter
by consideration of the unity of God.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PRIDE_AND_VANITY">PRIDE AND VANITY<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></h2>

</div>

<p>When a man feels a superiority over
others and with this a sort of inward elation,
this is called pride. It differs from vanity
in as much as vanity means consciousness
of one’s elation while pride requires a
subject, an object and a feeling of elation.
Suppose a man is born solitary in the
world, he may be vain but not proud,
because in pride man considers himself
superior to others for certain qualities of
his self. He allots one position to his self
and one to another, and then thinks that
his position is higher and is therefore
elated. This “puffed up” feeling which
imparts a sense of “touch me not” is called
pride. The Prophet says: “O God save
me from the puffing up of pride”. Ibn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Abbas says that the sentence in the Quran
“And they have pride in their hearts and
will fail to reach it” means that the thought
of inward greatness will be denied to them.
This thought is the source of inward and
outward actions, which are so to speak
the fruits of it.</p>

<p>A proud man will not tolerate any
other to be on equal terms with himself.
In private and in public he expects that
all should assume a respectful attitude
towards him and acknowledging his
superiority treat him as a higher being. They
should greet him first, make way for him
wherever he walks; when he speaks everyone
should listen to him and never try to
oppose him. He is a genius and people
are like asses. They should be grateful
to him seeing that he is so condescending.
Such proud men are found especially
among ulamas. Sages are ruined by
their pride. The Prophet says: “He who
has an atom of pride in his heart will fail
to enter paradise.” This saying requires<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
explanation, and should be carefully listened
to. Virtues are the doors of Paradise,
but pride and self esteem lock them all.
So long as man feels elated he will not
like for others what he likes for himself.
His self esteem will deprive him of humility,
which is the essence of righteousness.
He will neither be able to discard enmity
and envy, resentment and wrath, slander
and scorn, nor will he be able to cultivate
truth and sincerity, and calmly listen to
any advice. In short, there is no evil
which a proud man will not inevitably do
in order to preserve his elation and self-esteem.
Vices are like a chain of rings
linked together which entangle his heart.
Therefore, an atom of pride is Satan’s
spark, which secretly consumes the nature
of the sons of Adam.</p>

<p>Know then that pride is of three kinds:
1. Against God; 2. Against prophets
and saints; 3. Against fellowmen.</p>

<p>1. Against God. It is due to mere
foolishness when a biped creature considers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
himself as if Lord of the universe. Namrud
and Pharoah were such types, who
disdained to be called God’s creatures on
earth: “Verily, Verily,” says the Quran,
“the Messiah does by no means disdain
that he should be a servant of Allah, nor
do the angels who are near to Him, and
whoever disdains His service and is proud
He will gather them all together to Himself.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>2. Against prophets and saints. It is
due to unwarranted self esteem when one
considers obedience to any mortal being as
lowering his own position. Such a person
either fails to reflect on the nature of prophetship
and thereby feels proud of himself
and does not obey the prophet, or refuses
to consider the claims of prophetship
as being derogatory to his elated self and
therefore pays no regard to the prophet.
The Quran quotes the words of such persons:—“And
they say: what is the matter
with this Apostle that he eats food and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
goes about in the markets, why has not
an angel been sent down to him so that he
should have been a warner with him. Or
(why is not) a treasure sent down to him
or he is made to have a garden from
which he should eat”. And those
who do not fear our meeting, say: “Why
have not angels been sent down to us, or
(why) do we not see our Lord? Now
certainly they are too proud of themselves
and have revolted in great revolt.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Our Prophet Mohammed was an
orphan and had scanty means of livelihood,
so the Koraishite chief Walid bin
Moghera and Abu Masood Sakfi used to
speak contemptuously of him.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> And when
people believed in him and accepted
Islam, the proud Koraishites used to
say: Mohammed is surrounded by poor
men, let him send them off and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
then we of the aristocracy of Mecca will
listen to him. But God spoke to
Mohammed “And withhold thyself with
those who call on their Lord morning and
evening, desiring His good will, and let
not their eyes pass from them, desiring
the beauties of this world’s life, and do
not follow him, whose heart we have
made unmindful to our resemblance, and
he follows his low desires, and his case
is one in which due bounds are exceeded.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>3. Against fellowmen. A proud man
considers himself a superior being and
would like to see everybody humbled
before him. He is therefore quarrelling
with God, trying to share with Him His
attribute omnipotence. God is spoken
of in the Hadith, as saying: “Omnipotence
is my mantle, he who quarrels
with me for it, him will I crush”. Surely
men are all His servants and no servant
has a right to treat his fellow servants as
their master. But a proud man in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
intoxication of his elation takes himself as
God on earth. He is too haughty to listen
to truth from the lips of any of his fellowmen.
Ibn Masud says: “It is enough for
sin if a person, who is advised to fear God
answers his advisor: Look to thine own
self.”</p>

<p>The consciousness of superiority which
begets pride is due to certain attributes or
accomplishments which can be summed
up as:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">a. Spiritual, divided into (1)
knowledge; (2) devotion.</p>

<p class="hanging">b. Worldly, of five kinds: (3)
pedigree; (4) beauty; (5) strength;
(6) wealth; (7) kith and kin.</p>

</div>

<p>There are thus seven causes in all, and
these need some description.</p>

<p>Knowledge is power. Consciousness
of power easily elates a man, who considers
himself superior to others and treats them
in a supercilious manner. If he accepts
the greetings or the invitation of his
fellowmen or receives them in audience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
he thinks they should be thankful to him
for his condescension. People should obey
and serve him, for by virtue of his
knowledge he thinks he has a right over
them. Such a proud “Alim” is sorry
for the sins of others but unmindful of his
own condition. While he freely distributes
Heaven and Hell among his fellowmen,
he claims salvation and Heaven for himself.
The question is whether he is really
justified in holding the title of Alim. For
an Alim is one who, knowing himself knows
God, who fears the Lord most, who holds
himself more responsible for his actions for
he knows good and evil and feels the
awful presence of a mighty and just Being
who looks to righteousness alone.</p>

<p>Let us consider why men of knowledge
become proud. There are two main causes
which should be noted. First there is
a false conception about the nature of real
knowledge. Devoted to certain sciences
and arts such as mathematics, physics,
literature, and dialectics, they think that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
proficiency in them makes a man perfect.
But real knowledge means the lifting of
the veil from before the eyes of the heart
so as to see the mysterious relation between
man and his maker and to be filled
with a sense of awe and reverence in the
presence of an omniscient holy Being who
pervades the universe. This attitude
of mind, this enlightenment is real knowledge.
It produces humility and repels
pride.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is an indifference to
moral training during student life. Wicked
habits thus produce bitter fruits of pride.
Wahb has well illustrated this point, when
he says: “Knowledge is like rain falling
from above, so pure and sweet but the
plants when they absorb it, embitter or
sweeten it, according to their tastes.
Man in acquiring knowledge acquires
power, which gives strength to the
hidden qualities of his heart. If he was
prone towards pride and paid no attention
to the subjugation of it, he would prove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
more proud when he acquires knowledge.”
“There will be men,” says the
Prophet “who will have the Quran on
their lips but it will not go down their
throats. They will claim knowledge of it,
calling themselves learned Qari. They
will be from among you my companions,
but woe to them, for they will see the
consequence of it in Hell”.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Warned by their Prophet, his companions
lived a life of humility and their
example taught its lesson to their successors.
A person came to Khalif Omar
after morning prayers and said: “I should
like to give public sermons”. “My friend”,
said the Khalif, “I am afraid you would
soon be puffed up with pride”. Huzaifa,
the companion of the Prophet, was a
leader of prayer. One day he said to his
congregation: “Brethren, have another
leader, or go and pray alone, for I begin
to feel puffed up with your leadership”.</p>

<p>Thus, the companions of the Prophet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
lived meekly, the humble servants of God
on earth, keenly watching the changing
phases of their Hearts and promptly seeking
the remedy. But we who call ourselves
their followers not only do not try to
purify our hearts but do not even think
it worth while to consider the means for
their purification. How can we expect
salvation? But we ought not to lose
heart. The apostle of mercy for the
worlds (Rahmet ul lilalamin) has said:
“Soon a time will come when if any person
will do even one tenth of what you are
doing now, he will have his salvation”.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Devotion and religious service elicit
admiration and praise for the devotee,
who finding himself respected by the
people is elated. This elation quietly
develops into pride and then the devotee
considers himself a superior being and
favoured of God. He despises his fellow
men and calls them sinners, who will be
doomed for ever. But he does know that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
he himself will be doomed for despising
his fellowmen and thinking too much of
himself. The Prophet says: “When you
hear any person, saying: ‘Woe to the
people they are doomed,’ know that he himself
will be doomed first”.</p>

<p>It is recorded that a certain sinner
among the Jews passed by a well known
Pharisee. Struck with the appearance of
the Pharisee’s piety and devotion, the poor
sinner sat down by him, believing in the
saving grace of his holy touch. But the
proud Pharisee disdainfully spoke out:
“Touch me not thou filthy sinner, and
leave my presence”. Whereupon God
sent His word to the prophet of that age:
“Go and tell that sinner; thou art forgiven.
As for that Pharisee, his devotion is cast
aside and he is doomed”.</p>

<p>3. People are usually proud of their
lineage, and look down on men of low
birth. They refuse to treat them on
equal terms, and boastfully speak of their
ancestors in the presence of men, who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
treated by them in a haughty manner.
This evil lurks even in the hearts of good
and virtuous men, although their manners
and actions throw a veil over it. But in
an unguarded moment of excitement and
fury, this demon of pedigree is let loose
from the innermost corner of the heart.</p>

<p>The Prophet’s companion Abuzar says:
“I was quarrelling with someone in the
presence of the Prophet when suddenly in
a fit of rage I abused the man; Thou son
of a negress!” On this the Prophet coaxingly
said to me: “Abuzar, both the scales
are equal. The white has no preference
over the black.” Hearing this I
fell and said to the person: “Brother come
and trample on my face and then forgive
me.”</p>

<p>It is reported in the Hadith that two
men were quarrelling before the Prophet.
One said to the other; “I am the son of
such and such illustrious man, tell me
who thy father is?” The Prophet, addressing
the boastful man said; “There were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
two men in the time of Moses who boastfully
spoke of their pedigree. One said
to the other: “Look how my nine ancestors
all in one line were men of renown.” And
God said to Moses: “Tell this man: All
thy nine ancestors are in Hell and thou
art the tenth.”</p>

<p>4. Women generally feel proud of
their beauty. This leads to finding fault
with others, and this gradually assumes
the form of contempt and disdain. Ayesha,
the wife of the Prophet, says: “One day a
woman came to the Prophet and I said to
him: ‘Look at this dwarf.’ The Prophet
turned towards me and said: ‘Ayesha,
repent of what thou hast said, for it is
slander.’”</p>

<p>5, 6, 7. People feel a sort of elation
at the sight of their possessions. A merchant
is elated with his stores, a landowner
with his fields and groves, and a nobleman
with his retinue and riches. In short,
every person feels proud of his worldly
possessions and looks down on those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
are lacking in them. He believes in
riches and worships mammon.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> He has no
idea of what is meant by: “Blessed are
the poor in spirit: for their’s is the
kingdom of Heaven”.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>We may quote a parable from the
Quran. “And set forth to them a parable
of two men. For one of them we made
two gardens of grape vines, and we surrounded
them both with palms, and in the
midst of them we made corn-fields. Both
these gardens yielded their fruits and failed
nothing. We caused a river to gush
forth in their midst. The man possessed
much wealth and he said to his companion
while he disputed with him: I have greater
wealth than you and am mightier in
followers. While he entered his garden
he was unjust to himself. He said: I do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
not think that this will ever perish. I
do not think the hour will come, yet even
if I return to my Lord I shall most certainly
find a place better than this. His
companion said to him, while disputing
with him: Do you disbelieve in Him who
created you from dust, then from a small
germ life, then he made you a perfect
man? But as for me, Allah is my Lord
and I do not associate any one with my
Lord. When you entered your garden,
why did you not say: It is as Allah has
pleased. There is no power save Allah.
If you consider me to be inferior to you
in wealth and children, perhaps my
Lord will give me something better than
your garden, and send on it a reckoning
from heaven, so that it shall become even
ground with no living plant. Or the waters
may sink into the ground so that you are
unable to find them. His wealth was
indeed destroyed, and he began to wring
his hands for what he had spent on it.
While it lay there (for it had fallen down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
from the roofs) he said: Ah me! would
that I had not associated anyone with
my Lord. He had none to help him
besides Allah nor could he defend himself.
In Allah, alone is protection, the True
One. In the bestowal of reward and in
requital he is best.</p>

<p>Set forth to them also the parable of
the life in this world. It is like the water
which we send down from the clouds on
account of which the herbs become
luxuriant. Then these become dry, break
into pieces and the winds scatter them.
Allah holds power over all things. Wealth
and children are an adornment of the life of
this world. The good works, the ever-abiding,
are with your Lord better in
reward than in expectation”.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>How fleeting are our worldly gains,
and how foolish are we in feeling proud
of them! Let us then, live as meek and
humble servants of God on earth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FRIENDSHIP_AND_SINCERITY">FRIENDSHIP AND SINCERITY<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></h2>

</div>

<p>Friendship is one of God’s favours,
says the Quran. And hold fast by the
covenant of Allah all together and be not
disunited, and remember the favour of Allah
on you when you were enemies, then He
united your marts so by His favour you
became brethren<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. The Prophet says: Those
amongst you are my close companions
who have good dispositions, are affectionate
and tenderly love each other. And again:
“God when He shows His kindness towards
any person gives him a Good friend.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
“Verily God will say on the day of resurrection
where are those who loved each
other for my sake; today they shall rest
under my shelter when there is no other
shelter.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“Seven kinds of men will, on the Day of
Judgment, rest under His shelter when
there will be no other shelter:—(1) A
just Imam, (2) An adult who is devoted
to God, (3) A man who after coming out
from the mosque finds his heart attached
to it till he enters again, (4) Two friends
who lived and died in their friendship for
God’s sake, (5) He who for fear of the Lord
wept in secret, (6) He whom a beautiful
woman of good birth allures but he replies:
I have fear of my Lord, (7) He who gives
alms in a manner that his left hand does not
know what is given by his right hand.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Friendship, then, is God’s favour and
should be cultivated for His sake. But if we
shun the company of our fellowmen let
it also be for God’s sake. “The strongest
rope of Faith”, says the Prophet, “is love
and hate both for God’s sake.”</p>

<p>Christ says, “Love God by avoiding
the wicked; seek His nearness by shunning
their company and please Him by courting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
their displeasure.” “With whom should we
keep company, O Word of God”, asked
the people. And Christ replied, “Sit with
those whose appearance reminds you of
God, whose words add to the stock of your
knowledge and whose actions serve as an
incentive for acquiring the kingdom of
Heaven.”</p>

<p>God spoke to Moses saying, “Son of
Amran be up and find out a friend for
thee and he who would not be with thee
for my good will is thy enemy.”</p>

<p>Choose a friend who has five qualities
viz: wisdom, good disposition, abstinence
from sin, heresy and greed.</p>

<p>A fool’s company gives no good, it
ends in gloom. Good disposition is necessary
in as much as a man may be wise but
be subservient to his inordinate passion
and hence unfit for company. And a sinner
and a heretic are to be avoided for the
simple reason that they who have no fear
of the Lord and are regardless of committing
forbidden actions are not to be relied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
on. Besides contagion will secretly spread
and he too will think of sin lightly and
gradually lose power of resisting it. And
a greedy worldling is to be avoided because
his company will deaden the heart in the
quest of the kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>Alkama on his death bed gave a fine
description of a friend. “My son”, said he,
“If you wish to keep company try to find
out such a friend who, when you live with
him defends you, adds to your prestige,
bears the load of your hardships, helps
you in your doings, counts your virtues,
dissuades you from vices, readily responds
to your requests, inquires himself for
your needs when you keep quiet, shows
his deep sympathy in your sufferings,
bears witness to your sayings, gives good
advice when you intend to do some work
and prefers you to his own self when difference
arises between you and him.” This
piece of advice gives the qualities of a
friend in a nutshell. When Caliph Mamun
the Abbaside heard of it, he said, “Where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
should we find such a friend”. And Yahya
replied, “Alkama’s description means that
we should live in retirement.”</p>

<p>Imam Jafar ‘Assadiq’ (the veracious)
gives a negative description of a friend.
“Do not keep company with five sorts of
men viz: a false man who deceives you like
a mirage; a fool who cannot benefit you,
(even if he tries to do so he would do
harm through his foolishness;) a miser
who when you need his help the most,
severs himself from you; a coward who
will leave you when you are in danger; a
wicked sinner who will sell you for a piece
of bread.”</p>

<p>Sahl of Taster says, “Avoid the company
of 3 kinds of men, (1) tyrants who
forget God, (2) Ulamas who practise dissimulation,
(3) Sufis who are ignorant.”</p>

<p>It must be remembered here that the
above passages serve as an ideal but for
purposes we should look to the present
practical conditions and try to get as much
good as may be had from them. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
man’s life seems dreary when he has no
friends. And men are like trees. Some are
fruit-bearing and shady, some are shady
only and some are mere thorns and thistles.
Similarly some friends are a blessing both
here and hereafter; some are for worldly
gain for the world is a shadow, and some
are of no good in this world and the next
as if they are scorpions in human form.</p>

<p>“And they were not enjoined anything
except that they should serve Allah,
being sincere to Him in obedience, upright,
and keep up prayer and pay the poor rate
(zakat) and that is the right religion”.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
“Then serve God, being sincere in religion
unto Him, Aye, God’s is the sincere
religion”. Musab says that his father Saad
was considering himself superior to other
poor and destitute companions of the
Prophet. “God”, said the Prophet, “has
helped my people with my poor and
humble followers’ prayer and sincerity.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
“Sincere action,” says the Prophet “even
if it be little will suffice for thee.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The
following saying of the Prophet is reported
by Abu Huraira: “Three persons shall
be questioned first on the day of
resurrection. One will be the learned man
who would be asked as to what he had
done with his learning”. “Day and night,”
the learned man will reply “I tried my
best to propagate it, O Lord”. “Thou
speakest falsely”, God will answer
and the angels will also join with
him. “Thy sole aim was to be called a
learned man by the people, and the title
was thine”. The second will be the rich
man who would be asked about his riches.
“Day and night”, the rich man will reply,
“I gave it in charity.” “Thou speaker of
untruth”, God and his angels will say.
“Thou wishest to be labelled a generous
man, and it was done”. The third will be
the martyr who too will be asked about
his deed. “O Lord”, the martyr will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
reply, “Thou didst command us to wage
Holy war (Jehad), I obeyed thee and fell
fighting”. “Thou liest,” God and His
angels will answer. “Thy aim was to be
trumpeted as a hero and it was done”.
“Then,” says Abu Huraira, “the Prophet
after finishing the sermon pressed me and
said: These three would be the first to be
thrown into the flames of hell”.</p>

<p>In the narratives of the Israelites,
a story is told of a certain devotee who
had served God for many years. Once
he was informed of the apostacy
of a tribe, which, forsaking the true
worship of Yahweh had taken to tree
worship. The hermit filled with the spirit
of the “jealous” God took an axe and set
out to level the tree to the earth. But
the devil in the shape of an old man met
him on the way and inquired of his
intention. The hermit told him of his
determination, whereupon Satan addressed
him thus: “Why on earth are you leaving
aside your prayers and vigils and devoting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
yourself to other work!” “But this too is a
sacred cause” replied hermit. “No, nor
will I allow you to do so” exclaimed the devil.
Whereupon the hermit in the white heat of
his pious rage caught hold of the devil
and forcibly held him down. “Spare me
Sir”, begged the devil, “I have something
to say to you.” The hermit let him go.
Then spoke Satan; “I think God has not
commanded you to do this thing. You do
not worship the tree, you are not responsible
for the sins of others. If God wills
it he will send some prophet, and they
are so many, who would carry out his
order. So I think it is not your duty,
why then trouble yourself?” “But I
belong to the chosen people of Yahweh,
and I am in duty bound to do so”, replied
the hermit. Whereupon they again began
to wrestle and eventually Satan was thrown
down. “O! I see” cried Satan. “An idea
has just come into my mind; let me go
please, and I will tell you.” Thus obtaining
his release, the Evil One addressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
him as follows: “Is it not the case that you
are poor and have to live on the alms of
those who are devoted to you? But in
your heart of hearts you would like to
shower your bounties on your brethren and
neighbours so generous and compassionate
is your nature. What a pity that
such a noble soul lives on alms”. “You
have read my mind aright,” quietly responded
the hermit. “May I hope,” said the
Evil One entreatingly, “that you will be
pleased to accept two golden dinars which
you will find at your bed side every
morning from tomorrow. You will then
be relieved of depending on others and
be in a position to do charity to your
poor relations and brethren. As for that
wretched tree, what if that be cut down.
Surely your poor needy brethren would
get nothing and you would lose the
opportunity of helping them while the tree
would grow again”. The hermit pondered
over these words and said to himself
“This old man speaks quite reasonably,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
but let me think over the pros and cons
of the case. Am I a prophet? No, I am
not; therefore I am not bound to cut it
down. Am I commanded to do so? No.
Then if I do not do it I shall not be guilty
of the iniquity. Should I accept his proposal?
No doubt from the religious point
of view it is more useful. No doubt.
I think I should accept it: yes, I must.”
Thus the two pledged their words and the
hermit returned. Next morning he found
the two dinars at his bed side and
was highly pleased. Another morning
the glittering gold was there, but
on the third morning the hermit searched
for them in vain. His fury knew
no bounds. He rushed for his axe,
and hurried with it towards the place of
idolatry. Satan again met him in the
way as before. “Thou wretch, thou arch-devil”,
cried out the hermit “wilt thou
prevent me from my sacred duty?” “You
cannot do it, you dare not do it”, retorted
the Evil one. “Hast thou forgotten the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
test of my powers”, sharply replied the
infuriated hermit and rushed at him. But
to his great discomfort and humiliation
the hermit instantly fell flat on the ground
like a dry leaf from a tree. The devil
planted his foot on his chest, holding him
by the throat, dictating the following
terms: “Either swear not to touch that
tree or be prepared to die”. The hermit
finding himself quite helpless said, “I swear,
but tell me why I am so discomfitured”.
“Listen”, answered Satan. “At first thy
wrath was for God’s sake, and zealous
vindication of his commandments. Hence
I was defeated, but now thou art furious
for thyself, and worldly gain”. The story
illustrates the saying “I will certainly
cause them all to deviate from the way
except thy servants from among those who
are sincere”. A devotee cannot be immune
from Satan’s temptation except by
sincerity and therefore saint Maaruf of
Karkh used to upbraid himself, saying:
“If thou wishest salvation, be sincere”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>Yacub, the Sufi, says: “He who
conceals his virtues like vices, is sincere.”
In a dream a man saw a Sufi who was dead
and inquired about the actions of his
previous life. “All those actions” said the
Sufi, “which were for God’s sake I was
rewarded for, even the least of them.
For example, I had thrown aside a
pomegranate’s peel from the thoroughfare.
I found my dead cat but lost my ass worth
one hundred dinars, and a silken thread
on my cap was found on the side of
iniquities. Once, I gave something in
charity, and was pleased to see people
looking at me,—this action has neither
reward nor punishment for me”. “How
is it that you got your cat and lost your
ass?” said the man to the Sufi. “Because”,
responded the latter, “When I heard of
the death of my ass I said: ‘Damn it’. I
ought to have thought of God’s will”.
Saint Sufyan Saori, when he heard of
this dream, said, “The Sufi was fortunate
as no punishment was meted out to him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
for that charity which pleased him when
people watched him”.</p>

<p>There is a report that a man, putting
on a woman’s dress used to frequent purdah
parties in marriage and funeral processions.
Once a lady’s pearl was lost in a party.
Everybody was being closely searched,
and the man was very much afraid of the
disclosure of his identity, as it would
mean the loss of his life. He sincerely
repented in his heart, never to do the
same thing again, and asked God’s
forgiveness and help. Then he found that
it was now the turn of himself and his
companion to be searched. His prayer
was heard, the pearl being found in his
companion’s clothes and he was saved.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>A Sufi narrates the following story:
“I joined a naval squadron which was
going on holy war (Jehad). One of us was
selling his provision bag, and I bought
it, thinking it would prove useful in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
war, and that when the war was over I
might dispose of it with profit. That
same night I dreamt that two angels
came down from heaven. One of them
said to the other: Make a complete
list of the crusaders. The other began to
write down: So and so goes on a trip;
so and so for trading, so and so for reputation;
so and so for God’s sake. Then
he looked at me saying: Put this
man down as trader. But I spoke: For
God’s sake do not misrepresent me. I am
not going for business. I have no capital,
I have simply started for the holy war.
“But Sir”, said the angel “Did you not
buy that provision bag yesterday, and
were you not thinking of making some
profit?” I wept and entreated them not
to put me down as a trader. The angel
looked at the other, who said: “Well,
write thus: This man set out for the holy
war, but on the way bought a provision
bag for profiting: now God will judge
the man”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Saint Sari Saqati says: “Two rakats
of prayer offered with sincerity in seclusion
are better than copying seventy or seven
hundred traditions with the complete
list of authorities. Some say that one
moment’s sincerity is salvation, but it is
very rare. Knowledge is the seed, practice
is the crop, and sincerity is the water
nourishing it. Some say that God’s
displeasure is revealed in a person who
is given three things; and is denied the
same number. He gets access into the
society of the virtuous, but derives no
benefit therefrom. He performs good
actions but lacks sincerity. He learns
philosophy but fails to understand truth.”
Says Susi: “God looks to sincerity only,
and not to the action of his creatures”.
Says Junaid: “There are some servants of
God who are wise, who act as wise men,
who are sincere when they act, then
sincerity leads them to virtue.” Mohammed,
son of Said Marwazi, says: “The whole
course of our actions tends towards two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
principles, viz. (1) His treatment meted
out to thee; (2) thy action for him. Then
willingly submit to what is meted out to
thee and be sincere in all thy dealings. If
thou art successful in these two things thou
shalt be happy in both the worlds”.</p>

<p>Says Sahl: “Sincerity means that all
our actions or intentions—all the states of
our minds whether we are doing anything
or at rest, be solely for God.” But this is
very difficult to acquire as it does not in
the least attract the ego itself. Rowim
says: “Sincerity means disregard of recompense
for action in both the worlds”. In
this he wishes to point out that the gratifications
of our sensuous desires whether
in this world or the next are all insignificant
and low. He who worships God in
order to attain joy in paradise is not sincere.
Let him act for God’s “Riza”. This stage
is reached by Siddiks (Sincerely devoted to
God), and is sincerity <i>par excellence</i>. He
who does good actions for fear of hell or
hope of heaven is sincere in as much as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
gives up at present his sensual worldly
enjoyment, but wishes for the future, the
gratification of his appetite and passion in
paradise. The longing of true devotees is
their Beloved’s Riza. It may be objected
here that men’s motive is pleasure, that
freedom from such pleasures is a purely
divine attribute. But this objection is
based on misunderstanding. It is
true that man desires pleasure but pleasure
has different meanings. The popular
view is gratification of sensuous desires in
Paradise but it has no idea of the nature
of higher pleasures of communion and beatitude
or the vision of God, and hence
fails to consider them as pleasures. But
these are the pleasures and he who enjoys
them will not even look to the popular
pleasures of Paradise for his highest pleasure.
His summum bonum is the love of
God.</p>

<p>Tufail says: “To do good for men’s
sake is hypocrisy; not to do is infidelity;
sincere is he who is free from both and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
works for God only”. These definitions
suggest the ideal of sincerity aimed at by
noble souls. Let us now look to the
practical side of it for the sake of the
average man.</p>

<p>Actions make an impression on the
heart, and strengthen that quality of it
which served as a stimulus for them. For
example, hypocrisy deadens the heart and
godly motive leads to salvation. Both
of them will gather strength in proportion
to the actions which proceed from their
respective sources. But as they are
intrinsically opposed to each other an
action which gets an equal stimulus
at one and the same time will be stationary
in its effect on the heart. Now take a
mixed action which draws the doer nearer
to virtue, say, by one span, but removes
him away by two spans, the inward result
of his progress will be that he would
remain where he was, although he would
be rewarded or punished according to his
motive. A man starts for “Haj” but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
takes with him some articles for trade,
he will get his reward of pilgrimage but
if his motive was trade only, he could not
be considered a “Haji”. A crusader who
fights for his religion would have his
recompense although he acquires booty,
for so long as his sole motive is to uphold
the cause of religion the latent desire of
booty would not come in the way of his
recompense. Granted that he is inferior to
those noble souls who are wholly absorbed
in Him “who see through Him, who hear
through Him, who act through Him,”
(Hadis) He still belongs to the good and
the virtuous. For if we apply the highest
standard to all, religion will be considered
a hopeless task, and will ultimately be
reduced to pessimism.</p>

<p>At the same time we must sound a
note of warning for those who are satisfied
with the low standard. They are very
often deceived. They consider their
motive is purely for God’s sake while
in reality they aim at some hidden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
sensuous pleasure. Let a doer, after he
has exerted himself and pondered over
his motive, be not over-confident of his
sincerity. With the fear of its rejection
let him hope for its acceptance—this is the
creed of the righteous who fears the Lord
and hopes from him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NATURE_OF_LOVE">THE NATURE OF LOVE<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></h2>

</div>

<p>Experiences are either agreeable and
therefore desired or disagreeable and
avoided. Inclination towards a desired
object when deeply rooted and strong
constitutes love. Knowledge and perception
of the beloved is the first requisite for
love which is consequently divided
according to the division of the five
senses each of which is inclined
towards its desired object. Thus the
eye apprehends beautiful forms, the
ear harmonious sounds, etc. This kind
of experience we share with the animals.
There is, however, one more sense,
peculiar to man, which delights the soul.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
The prophet has said: “I desire three
things from your world, sweet smell,
tender sex, and prayer, which is the
delight of my eye”. Now prayer is
neither smelt nor touched—in fact its
delight is beyond the scope of the five
senses and yet it has been described as the
“delight of my eye”, which means the
inner eye—the soul with her sixth sense.
Concepts of this special sense are more
beautiful and charming than sensuous
objects—nay, they are more perfect and
strongly attract the soul. Is it not, then,
possible, that One who is not perceived
by the five senses may yet be found and
felt attractive by that sense and loved by
the soul?</p>

<p>Let us now enumerate the circumstances
which excite love. 1. Every living being
first of all loves his own self, that is to
say, the desire for continuity of his existence
as opposed to annihilation is innate.
This desire is augmented by the desire of
the perfection of his self by means of
sound body, wealth, children, relations and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
friends. For all of these serve as a means
to the end of the continuity of his self and
therefore he cherishes love for them.
Even “unselfish” love of his dear son,
if probed, smacks of love for the
continuity of his self, because his son who
is part of his self serves as a living
representative of his self’s continuity.</p>

<p>2. The second cause is the love for
one’s benefactor towards whom the heart
is naturally attracted. Even if he be a
stranger, a benefactor will always be loved.
But it must be remembered that the benefactor
is loved not for himself, but for his
beneficence, the extent of which will be a
dominating factor in determining the degree
of love.</p>

<p>3. The third cause is love of beauty.
It is generally supposed that beauty consists
in red and white complexions, well
proportioned limbs, and so forth, but
we can also say “beautiful writing”,
“beautiful horse”, etc. Hence beauty of an
object consists in its possession of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
possible befitting perfections. It will vary
in proportion to the perfections attained.
That writing in which all the rules of
caligraphy are properly observed will be
called beautiful and so on. At the same
time there can be no one standard for
judging the beauty of different objects.
The standard for a horse cannot be the
same for, say, writing or man. It must
also be remembered that beauty is not
connected with sensible objects only but
is also related to concepts. A person is not
always loved for his external beauty, but
often the beauty of his knowledge or
virtues attracts the heart. It is not necessary
that the object of such kind of love be perceived
by the senses. We love our saints,
imams, and prophets but we have never
seen them. Our love for them is so strong
that we would willingly lay down our
lives for upholding their good name. If
we wish to create love for them in young
minds we can produce it by giving graphic
accounts of their virtues. Stories of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
heroes of any nation will excite love for
them.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind; and
therefore is winged Cupid painted blind”.</p>

</div>

<p>4. The fourth cause is a sort of secret
affinity between two souls, meeting and
attracting each other. It is what is
called “love at first sight”. This is what
the prophet meant when he said “The
souls had their rendezvous: Those who
liked each other, then love here; those
who remained strangers then do not join
here”. If a believer goes to a meeting
where there are a hundred manafiks
(hypocrites) and one momin (faithful) he
will take his seat by the side of the momin.
It seems that likes are attracted by their
likes. Malik bin Dinar says: Just as birds
of the same feather fly together two
persons having a quality common to both
will join.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>Let us now apply these causes and
find out who may be the true object of love.
First, man who is directly conscious of
his own self in whom the love for continuity
of the self is innate, if he deeply thinks on
the nature of his existence will find that
he does not exist of his own self, nor are the
means of the continuity of his self in his
power. There is a being, self-existent, and
living who created and sustains him. The
Quran says: “There surely came over man
a period of time when he was not a thing
that could be spoken of. Surely we have
created man from a small life germ uniting.
We mean to try him, so we have made him
hearing, seeing. Surely we have shown
him the way, he may be thankful
or unthankful.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> This contemplation will
bear the fruit or love for God. For how
could it be otherwise when man loves his
own self which is dependent on Him,
unless he be given up to the gratification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
of his passions and thereby forgetting his
true self and his sustainer.</p>

<p>Secondly, if he thinks over the aim
and scope of beneficence, he will find that
no creature can show any purely disinterested
favour to another because his
motive will be either 1. praise or
self-gratification for his generosity, or 2.
hope of reward in the next world or divine
pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Paradoxical though it sounds,
deep insight into human nature leads us,
inevitably to the conclusion that man
cannot be called “benefactor”, in as much
as his action is prompted by the idea of
gain and barter. A true benefactor is one
who in bestowing his favours has not the
least idea of any sort of gain. Purely
disinterested beneficence is the quality of
the All-merciful Providence and hence He
is the true object of love.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the appreciation of inward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
beauty, that is to say the contemplation
of any attractive quality or qualities of the
beloved causes a stronger and more durable
love than the passionate love of the flesh.
However such a beloved will still be found
lacking in beauty from the standpoint of
perfection because the three genders are
creatures and therefore cannot be called
perfect. God alone is perfect beauty—holy,
independent, omnipotent,
all-majesty, all-beneficent, all-merciful.
With all this knowledge of His attributes
we still do not know Him as He is. The
prophet says: “My praise of Thee cannot
be comprehensive, Thou art such as
wouldst praise Thyself”.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Are not these
attributes sufficient to evoke love for him?
But beatitude is denied to the inwardly
blind. They do not understand the attitude
of the lovers of God towards Him. Jesus
once passed by some ascetics who were
reduced in body. “Why are you thus”? he
said to them. And they replied “Fear of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
hell and hope of heaven have reduced us
to this condition”. “What a pity”, rejoined
Jesus, “your fear and hope is limited to
creatures”. Then he went onward and
saw some more devotees, and put the same
question. “We are devoted to God and
revere him for his love”, they replied
with downcast eyes. “Ye are the saints”
exclaimed Jesus, “you will have my
company”.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Fourthly, the affinity between two
souls meeting and loving each other is a
mystery, but more mysterious is the
affinity between God and his loving
devotee. It cannot and must not be
described before the uninitiated. Suffice it
to say that the souls possessing the higher
qualities of beneficence, sympathy, mercy,
etc. have that affinity hinted at in the
following saying of the prophet: “Imitate
divine attributes”. For man has been
created in the image of God, nay he is,
in a way, akin to Him, says the Quran.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
“And when the Lord said to the angels:
Surely I am going to create a mortal from
dust, so when I have made him complete,
and breathed into him of My Ruh (soul),
fall down making obeisance to him”.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It is
this affinity which is pointed out in the
following tradition: God said to Moses “I
was sick and thou didst not visit Me”.
Moses replied “O God, thou art Lord
of heaven and earth: how couldst thou be
sick?” God said “A certain servant of
mine was sick: hadst thou visited him,
thou wouldst have visited me”. Therefore
our prophet Mahommed has said: “Says
God: My servant seeks to be near me
that I may make him my friend, and
when I have made him my friend, I become
his ear, his eye, his tongue.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It
must, however, be remembered that
mystical affinity vaguely conceived leads
to extremes. Some have fallen into abject
anthropomorphism; others have gone so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
far as to believe in the airy nothings of
pantheism. These are all vagaries of the
imagination, whether they take the form
of “Ibn Allah”, (Son of God) or “Anal
Haq” (I am God).<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> They are to a great
extent responsible for the evils of superstition
and scepticism.</p>

<p>These four causes when properly understood,
demonstrate that the true object
of our love is God and therefore it has been
enjoined: “Thou shalt love the lord thy
God with all thy heart and with all thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
soul and with all thy mind”.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<h3>Man’s highest happiness</h3>

<p>The constitution of man possesses a
number of powers and propensities, each
of which has its own distinctive kind of
enjoyment suited to it by nature. The
appetite of hunger seeks food which preserves
our body and the attainment of
which is the delight of it, and so with every
passion and propensity when their particular
objects are attained. Similarly the
moral faculty—call it inward sight, light of
faith or reason—any name will do provided
the object signified by it is rightly understood—delights
in the attainment of its
desideratum. I shall call it here the faculty
of reason (not that wrangling reason
of the Scholastics and the dialecticians)—that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
distinctive quality which makes
him lord of creation. This faculty delights
in the possession of all possible knowledge.
Even an expert in chess boastfully delights
in the knowledge of the game however
insignificant it may be. And the higher
the subject matter of our knowledge the
greater our delight in it. For instance we
would take more pleasure in knowing the
secrets of a king than the secrets of a vizier.
Now delights are either (a) external, derived
from the five senses, or (b) internal,
such as love of superiority and power, love
of the knowledge, etc. enjoyed by the mind.
And the more the mind is noble the more
there will be a desire for the second kind
of delights. The simple will delight in
dainty dishes, but a great mind leaving
them aside will endanger his life and his
honour and reputation from the jaws of
death. Even sensuous delights present
an amusing example of preference. An
expert in chess while absorbed in playing
will not come to his meals though hungry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
and repeatedly summoned, because the
pleasure of check-mating his adversary is
greater to him than the object of his appetite.
Thus we see that inward delights
and they are chiefly love of knowledge
and superiority are preferred by noble
minds. If then a man believes in a perfect
being, will not the pleasure of His contemplation
be preferred by him and will it
not absorb his whole self? Surely the delights
of the righteous are indescribable, for
they are even in this life, in a paradise
which no eye has seen and no ear has heard.</p>

<p>Abu Sulaiman Darani,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> the renowned
Sufi, says: “There are servants of God
whom neither fear of hell nor the hope of
heaven can deviate from the divine love,
how can the world with its temptations
come in their way?”. Abu Mahfuz Karkhi
was once asked by his disciples: “Tell us
what led you to devotion” but he kept
quiet. “Is it the apprehension of death.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
said one of them. “It matters little” replied
the saint “Is it due to hell or to paradise”,
inquired another. “What of
them” said the saint “both belong to a
supreme Being, if you love him you will
not be troubled by them”. Saint Rabia<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
was once asked about her faith: “God
forbid”, answered Rabia: “If I serve him
like a bad labourer thinking of his wages
only”. And then she sang: “Love draws
me nigh, I know not why”. Thus we see
that the hearts of those who ate and drank
and breathed like us felt delights of divine
love which was their highest happiness.</p>

<p>If we think over man’s gradual development
we find that every stage of his life
is followed by a new sort of delight. Children
love playing and have no idea of
the pleasures of courtship and marriage
experienced by young men, who in
their turn would not care to exchange
their enjoyments for wealth and greatness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
which are the delights of the middle aged
men who consider all previous delights as
insignificant and low. These last mentioned
delights are also looked upon as
unsubstantial and transitory by pure and
noble souls fully developed.</p>

<p>The Quran says: “Know that this
world’s life is only sport and play and
boasting among yourselves, and vying in
the multiplication of wealth and children”.
“Say, shall I tell you what is better than
these? For the righteous are gardens
with their Lord, beneath which rivers
flow, to abide in them and pure mates and
Allah’s pleasure and Allah sees the
servants”. “Those who say: Our Lord,
surely we believe, so forgive us our faults,
and keep us from the chastisement of
fire; the patient and the truthful and the
obedient and those who spend (benevolently)
and those who ask forgiveness in
morning times”.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Let us now point out some drawbacks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
which hinder the path of the divine love.</p>

<p>Man from his infancy is accustomed to
enjoy sensual delights which are firmly
implanted in him. Blind imitation of the
creed with vague conception of the deity
and his attributes fails to eradicate sensual
delights and evoke the raptures of divine
love. It is the dynamic force of direct
contemplation of his attributes manifested
in the universe that can prove an
incentive for his love. To use a figure: a
nation loves its national poet, but the
feeling of one who studies the poet will
be of exceeding strong love. The world is
a masterpiece; he who studies it loves its
invisible Author in a manner which cannot
be described but is felt by the favoured
few. Another drawback which sounds
like a paradox, should be deeply studied.
It is as follows: when we find a person
writing or doing any other work, the fact
that he is living will be most apparent to
us: that is to say, his life, knowledge,
power and will will be more apparent to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
us than his other internal qualities,
e.g. colour, size, etc. which being perceived
by the eye may be doubted. Similarly
stones, plants, animals, the earth, the sky,
the stars, the elements, in fact everything
in the universe reveals to us the
knowledge, power and the will of its
originator. Nay, the first and the foremost
proof is our consciousness, because the
knowledge that I exist is immediate,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
and more apparent than our perceptions.
Thus we see that man’s actions are
but one proof of his life, knowledge, power
and will, but with reference to God the
whole phenomenal existence with its law
of causation and order and adaptability
bears testimony of him and his attributes.
Therefore, He is so dazzlingly apparent
that the understanding of the people fails
to see Him just as the bat pereeaes
at night fails to see in daylight,
because its imperfect sight cannot
bear the light of the sun, so our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
understanding is blurred by the effulgent
light of his manifestations. The fact is
that objects are known by their opposites
but the conception of one who exists
everywhere and who has no opposite would
be most difficult. Besides, objects which
differ in their respective significances can
also be distinguished but if they have
common significances the same difficulty
will be felt. For instance if the sun would
have shone always without setting, we
could have formed no idea of light,
knowing simply that objects have certain
colours. But the setting of the sun revealed
to us the nature of light by comparing it
with darkness. If then light, which is
more perceptible and apparent would
have never been understood had there
been no darkness notwithstanding its
undeniable visibility, there is no wonder if
God who is most apparent and all pervading
true light (Nur)<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> remains hidden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
because if he would have disappeared
(which means the annihilation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
universe), there would have been an idea
of him by comparison as in the case of the
light and darkness. Thus we see that the
very mode of his existence and
manifestation is a drawback for human
understanding. But he whose inward
sight is keen and has strong intuition
in his balanced state of mind neither sees
nor knows any other active power save
God omnipotent. Such a person neither
sees the sky as the sky nor the earth as
the earth—in fact sees nothing in the universe
except in the light of its being work
of an all pervading True One. To use a
figure: if a man looks at a poem or a writing,
not as a collection of black lines scribbled
on white sheets of paper but as a work
of a poet or an author, he ought not to be
considered as looking to anything other
than the author. The universe is a unique<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
masterpiece, a perfect song, he who reads
it looks at the divine author and loves
him. The true Mowahhid is one who sees
nothing but God. He is not even aware
of his self except as servant of God. Such
a person will be called absorbed in Him;
he is effaced, the self is annihilated. These
are facts known to him who sees intuitively,
but weak minds do not know them. Even
Ulamas fail to express them adequately
or consider the publicity of them as unsafe
and unnecessary for the masses.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_UNITY_OF_GOD">THE UNITY OF GOD<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></h2>

</div>

<p>There are four stages in the belief in
the unity of God. The first is to utter the
words: “There is no God but God” without
experiencing any impression in the heart.
This is the creed of the hypocrites. The
a second is to utter the above words and to
believe that their meaning is also true.
This is the dogma of ordinary Muslims.
The third is to perceive by the inward
light of the heart the truth of the above
Kalima. Through the multiplicity of causes
the mind arrives at the conception of
the unity of the final cause. This is the
stage of the initiates. The fourth is to
gaze at the vision of an all-comprehensive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
all-absorbing One, losing sight even of the
duality of one’s own self. This is the
highest stage of the true devotee. It is
described by the Sufis as Fanafittauhid
(i.e. the effacement of one’s individuality
in contemplating the unity of God).<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> To
use a simile these four stages may be compared
with a walnut which is composed of
an external hard rind, an internal skin, the
kernel, and oil. The hard rind, which is bitter
in taste, has no value except that it serves
as a covering for some time. When the
kernel is extracted the shell is thrown
away. Similarly the hypocrite who, uttering
the Kalima, is associated with the
Muslims and safely enjoys their privileges,
but at death is cut off from the faithful
and falls headlong into perdition. The internal
skin is more useful than the external
in as much as it preserves the kernel
and may be used, but is in no way equal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
to the kernel itself. Similarly the dogmatic
belief of the ordinary Muslim is better
than the lip service of the hypocrite, but
lacks that broad clear insight which is
described as “He whose heart Allah has
opened to Islam walks in his light”.</p>

<p>The kernel is undoubtedly the desired
object, but it contains some substance
which is removed when oil is being pressed
out. Similarly the conception of an efficient
final cause is the aim and object of
the devotees, but is inferior to the vision
of the all-pervading Holy One, because
the conception of causality involves duality.</p>

<p>But the objection may be urged: How
can we ignore the diversities and multiplicities
of the universe? Man has hands and
feet, bones and blood, heart and soul,—all
distinct—yet he is one individual. When
we are thinking of a dear old friend and
suddenly he stands before us, we do not
think of any multiplicity of his bodily organs,
but are delighted to see him. The
simile, though not quite appropriate is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
suggestive, especially for beginners. When
they reach that stage they will themselves
see its truth. Words fail to express the
beatitude of that highest stage. It can be
enjoyed, but not described.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Let us consider the nature of the third
stage. Man finds that God alone is the prime
cause of everything. The world, its objects,
life, death, happiness, misery, all have their
source in his omnipotence. None is associated
with Him in this. When man comes to
recognise this, he has no fear of anything,
but puts his trust in God alone. But
Satan tempts him by misrepresenting the
agencies of the inorganic and organic
worlds as potent factors independent in
the shaping of his destiny.</p>

<p>Think first of the inorganic world.
Man thinks that crops depend on rain
descending from clouds, and that clouds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
gather together owing to normal climatic
conditions. Similarly his sailing on the
sea depends on favourable winds. Without
doubt, these are immediate causes, but
they are not independent. Man who in
the hour of need calls for God’s mysterious
help, forgets Him and turns to external
causes as soon as he finds himself safe
and sound. “So, when they ride in ships,
they call upon Allah, being sincerely obedient
to Him, but when he brings them safe
to land, they associate others with
Him. Thus they become ungrateful for
what we have given them, so they might
enjoy: but they shall soon know”.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> If a
culprit, whose death sentence is revoked
by the king, looks to the pen as his deliverer,
will it not be sheer ignorance and
ingratitude? Surely, the sun, the moon,
the stars, the clouds, in fact, the whole
universe is like a pen in the hand of an
omnipotent dictator. When this kind of
belief takes hold of the mind, Satan is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
disappointed in covertly tempting man,
and uses subtle means, insinuating thus:
“Do you not see that the king has full
power either to kill or favour you, and
though the pen, in the above simile, is not
your deliverer, the writer certainly is”?
As this sort of reflection led to the vexed
question of free will, we have dealt with
it already at some length.</p>

<p>At the outset, let us point out that
just as an ant, owing to its limited sight
will see the point of the pen blackening a
blank sheet of paper and not the fingers
and hand of the writer, so the person
whose mental sight is not keen will attribute
the actions to the immediate doer
only. But there are minds, which, with
the searchlight of intuition, expose the
lurking danger of wrongly attributing
power to any except the all-powerful omniscient
being. To them every atom in
the universe speaks out the truth of this
revelation. They find tongues in trees,
books in the running brooks, sermons in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
stones. The worldling will say: Though
we have ears, we do not hear them.
But asses also having ears do not hear.
Verily there are such ears which hear
words that have no sound, that are neither
Arabic nor any other language, known to
man. These words are drops in the boundless
unfathomable ocean of divine knowledge:
“If the sea were ink for the words
of my Lord, the sea would surely be consumed
before the words of my Lord are
exhausted.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LOVE_OF_GOD_AND_ITS_SIGNS">THE LOVE OF GOD AND ITS SIGNS<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></h2>

</div>

<p>Love of God is the highest stage of our
soul’s progress and her summum bonum. Repentance,
patience, piety, and other virtues
are all preliminary steps. Although rare
these qualities are found in true devotees
and the commonality, though devoid of
them, at any rate believe in them. Love of
God is not only very rare: the possibility of
it is doubted, even by some Ulamas who call
it simply service. For, in their opinion
love exists amongst species of the same
kind, but God being ultra-mundane and
not of our kind, His love is an impossibility
and hence the much talked of ecstatic
states of the “true lovers of God” are mere
delusions. As this is far from truth and
impedes the progress of the soul, by spreading
false notions, we shall briefly discuss
the subject. First we shall quote passages
from the Quran and the Hadith testifying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
to the existence of the love of God.</p>

<p>“O you who believe, whosoever from
among you turns back from his religion,
then Allah will bring a people: He shall
love them, and they shall love him, lowly
before the believers, mightily against the
unbelievers, they shall strive hard in
Allah’s way and shall not fear the censure
of any censurer: this is Allah’s grace,
He gives it to whom He pleases and
Allah is ample-giving, knowing.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>“And there are some among men who
take for themselves objects of worship besides
Allah, whom they love. Allah and
those who believe are stronger in love of
Allah.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> These passages not only refer
to the existence of the love of God but point
to the difference in degree. The Prophet
has taught us that the love of God is one
of the conditions of faith. “None among
you shall be a believer until he loves Allah
and his apostle more than anything else.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>True, as the Quran says “If your
fathers and your sons and your brethren
and your mates and your kinsfolk and property
which you have acquired and trade,
the dullness of which you fear, and dwellings
which you like, are dearer to you
than Allah and His apostle and striving
in His way, then wait till Allah brings
about His command, and Allah does not
guide the transgressing people.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>A man came to the Prophet and said: “I
love thee, O Apostle of God”. “Be ready
for poverty.” replied the Prophet. “And
I love Allah”, said the man. “Prepare
to face tribulations”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> replied the Prophet.
The following tradition is narrated by the
Khalif Omar: The Prophet one day saw
Masah, son of Umair coming to him with
a lambskin round his loins. “Look” said
the Prophet to his companions, “how God
has illumined his heart. I have seen him
living in ease and well provided by his
parents but now the love of Allah and His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
apostle has wrought a change in him.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The Prophet used to pray thus: “My
God, give me thy love and the love of him
who loves thee and the love of that action
which will bring me nearer to thee and
make thy love sweeter than cold water to
the thirsty”.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>“Verily Allah loves those who repent
and those who purify themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Say
“If you love Allah, then follow me. Allah
will love you and forgive you your faults,
and Allah is forgiving, merciful”.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> We
have said before that love means yearning
towards a desired object and that beneficence
and beauty, whether perceived or
conceived, equally attract our hearts. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
in using the word love for God, no such
meaning is possible as it implies imperfection.
God’s love towards men is the love
of His own work. Someone read the
following verse of the Quran: “He loves
them and they love him” in front of Shaikh
Abu Said of Mohanna, who interpreted
it saying: “He loves Himself because he
alone exists. Surely an author who likes
himself; his love is limited to his self.”
God’s love means the lifting the veil from
the heart of His servant, so that he might
gaze at Him. It also means drawing him
close to Himself. Let us give an illustration.
A king permits some of his slaves to
approach his presence, not because he
requires them but because the slaves
possess or are acquiring certain qualities
which are worthy of being displayed
before the royal presence. This privilege,
this lifting of the veil, brings us nearer to
the conception of God’s love. But it
must be remembered that approaching the
divine presence should entirely exclude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the idea of space, for then it would imply
change in Him, which is absurd. Divine
proximity means the attainment of godly
virtues by abstaining from the promptings
of the flesh and hence it implies
approach from the point of view of quality
and not of space. For example, two
persons meet together either when both of
them proceed towards each other or one
is stationary and the other starts and
approaches him. Again a pupil strives to
come up to the level of his teacher’s
knowledge who is resting in his elevated
position. His uphill journey towards
knowledge keeps him restless, and he
climbs higher and higher till he catches a
glimpse of the halo which surrounds his
master’s countenance. The nature
of divine proximity resembles this
inward journey of the pupil; that is, the
more a man acquires insight into the
nature of things, and by subjugating
his passions leads the life of righteousness,
the nearer will he be coming to his lord.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
But it must be remembered that a pupil
may equal his teacher, even be greater
than he, but as regards divine proximity, no
such equality is possible. God’s love
means that which purifies the heart of his
servant in a manner that he may be worthy
of being admitted before his holy presence.</p>

<p>It may be asked: “How can we know
that God loves a certain person?” My
answer is that there are signs which bear
testimony to it. The Prophet says: When
God loves his servant, He sends tribulations,
and when He loves him most he severs his
connection from everything. Some one
said to Jesus: “Why do you not buy a
mule for yourself”? Jesus answered: “My
God will not tolerate that I should concern
myself with a mule”. Another saying of Mohammed
is reported thus: When God loves
any of His servants He sends tribulations,
if he patiently bears them, he is favoured,
and if he cheerfully faces them, he is
singled out as chosen of God. Surely it
is this joyous attitude of his mind whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
evil befalls him or good, that is the chief
sign of love. Such minds are providentially
taken care of in their thoughts and deeds
and in all their dealings with men. The
veil is lifted and they live in wrapped
communion.</p>

<p>As for the signs of a man’s love for
God, let it be borne in mind that every
body claims His love, but few really love
Him. Beware of self-deception; verify
your statement by introspection. Love
is like a tree rooted in the ground sending
its shoots above the starry heaven; its
fruits are found in the heart, the tongue
and the limbs of the lover—in fact his
whole self is a witness to love just as
smoke is a sure sign of fire burning.</p>

<p>Let us, then, trace the signs which are
found in the true lover.</p>

<p>Death is a pleasure to him, for it removes
the barrier of body and lets the fluttering
soul free to soar and sing in the blissful
abode of his beloved. Sufyan Thauri and
Hafi used to say: “He who doubts dislikes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
death, because a friend will never dislike
meeting a friend”.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>A certain Sufi asked a hermit whether
he wished for death, but he gave no answer.
Then the Sufi said to him: “Had you
been a true hermit you would have liked
death. The Quran says: If the future
abode with Allah is especially for you to
the exclusion of the people, then invoke
death if you are truthful. They will never
wish it on account of what their hands
have sent on before, and Allah knows the
unjust”.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The hermit replied: “But the
Prophet says: ‘Do not wish for death’”.
“Then you are suffering”, said the Sufi,
“because acquiescence in divine decree is
better than trying to escape it”.</p>

<p>It may be asked here: Can he who
does not like death be God’s lover? Let
us consider first the nature of his dislike.
It is due to his attachment to the worldly
objects, wife, children, and so forth, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
it is possible that with this attachment,
which no doubt comes in the way of his
love of God there may be some inclination
towards His love, because there are
degrees of His love. Or it may be that his
dislike is due to his feeling of unpreparedness
in the path of love. He would like to
love more so that he might be able to purify
himself just as a lover hearing of his beloved’s
arrival would like to be given some
time for making preparations for a fitting
reception. For these reasons if a devotee
dislikes death, he can still be His lover,
though of inferior type.</p>

<p>He should prefer, both inwardly and
outwardly, God’s pleasure to his desires.
For he who follows the dictates of his
desires is no true lover, for the true lover’s
will is his beloved’s. But human nature is
so constituted that such selfless beings
are very rare. Patients would like to be
cured but they often eat things which are
injurious to their health. Similarly, a
person would like to love God but very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
often follows his own impulses. Naaman
was a sinner, who being repeatedly excused
by the Prophet was at last flogged. While
he was being flogged a certain person
cursed him for his iniquity. “Do not curse
him”, said he “he has a regard for God and
his apostle”.</p>

<p>Experience tells us that he who loves
loves the things connected with his beloved.
Therefore another sure sign of God’s love
is the love of his creatures who are created
by and are dependent on him; for he who
loves an author or poet, will he not love
his work or poem? But this stage is reached
when the lover’s heart is immersed
in love and the more he is absorbed in
Him, the more will he love His creatures,
so much so that even the objects which
hurt him will not be disliked by him—in
fact the problem of evil is transcended in
his love for him.</p>

<p>It may be objected here that it follows
that he loves the evil-doers and sinners.
But a deep insight into the nature of such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
love shows that he loves them as creatures
of God, but at the same time hates their
actions which are contrary to the command
of his beloved. If this point is lost sight
of, people are apt to be misguided in their
love or hatred of His creatures. If they
show their love towards any sinner, let it
be in pure compassion, and not any sense
of taking the sin lightly. Similarly their
hatred should proceed from the consciousness
of His stern law and justice and not
from ruthless bigotry.</p>

<p>In one of the Hadisi-Qudsi<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> God has
said: “My saints are those who cry like a
child for my love, who remember me like
a fearless lion at the sight of iniquities”.</p>

<p>A reverent attitude of mind is another
sign of his love. Some hold that fear is
opposed to love, but the truth is that just
as the conception of beauty generates love,
the knowledge of his sublime majesty produces
the feeling of awe in us. Lovers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
meet with fears which are unknown to
others.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> There is the fear of being disregarded.
There is fear of the veil being
drawn down. There is the fear of their
being turned away. When the Sura Hud
was revealed, in which the awful doom of
the wicked nations is narrated,: “Away
with Samood, away with Midian,” the
Prophet heaved a sigh and said: “This
Sura has turned me into an old man.”
He who loves His nearness will feel acutely
the fear of being way from Him. There
is another fear of remaining at a particular
stage and not rising higher, for the ascending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
degrees of His nearness are infinite.
A true lover is always trying to draw nearer
and nearer to Him. “A thin veil covers
my heart,” says the Prophet, “then I
ask for His forgiveness seventy times in
day and night.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> This means that the
Prophet was always ascending the scales
of his nearness, asking for His forgiveness
at every stage which was found lower than
the next one.</p>

<p>There is another fear of over confidence
which slackens the efforts and mars progress.
Hope with fear should be the guide
of love. Some Sufis say that he who worships
God without fear is liable to err and
fall; he who worships him with fear turns
gloomy and is cast off, but he who lovingly
worships him with hope and fear is admitted
by him and favoured. Therefore lovers
should fear him and those who fear
him should love him. Even excess of
his love contains an inkling of fear: it is
like salt in food. For human nature cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
bear the white heat of His love, if it
is not chastened and tempered by the fear
of the Lord.</p>

<p>Keeping love secret and giving no
publicity to it is another sign of His love.
For love is the beloved’s secret: it should
not be revealed nor openly professed.
However, if he is over-powered by the
force of his love, and unwittingly and
without the least dissimulation his secret
is out, he is not to be blamed. Some Sufis
say: He who is very often pointing towards
Him is far from Him, because he feigns
and makes a show of his love of Him.
Zunnun<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> of Egypt once went to pay a visit
to one of his brother Sufis, who was in
distress, and who used to talk of his love
openly. “He who feels the severity of
pain inflicted by Him,” said Zunnun,
“is no lover.” “He who finds no pleasure
in such pain,” returned the Sufi, “is no
lover.” “True,” replied Zunnun, “but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
I say to you that he who trumpets his
love of Him is no lover.” The Sufi felt the
force of Zunnun’s words and fell down
prostrate before God and repented and
did not talk again of his love.</p>

<p>It may be objected: Divine love is the
highest stage, it would be better to manifest
it, where is the harm? No doubt love
is good and if of itself it is evident, there
is no harm, but those who give themselves
trouble to make it known are blameable.
Let our hearts speak, let our deeds
proclaim it, but not our tongue. Nay,
he should always aim at making it evident
before his beloved. The gospel says:
“Take heed that ye do not give your alms
before men to be seen: otherwise ye have
no reward of your Father which is in
heaven. Therefore, when thou doest thine
alms do not sound a trumpet before thee
as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
and in the streets, that they may have
the glory of men. Verily I say unto you
they have their reward. But when thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
doest alms let not thy left hand know
what thy right hand doeth. That thine
alms may be in secret, and thy Father
which seeth in secret himself shall reward
thee openly. Moreover when ye fast, be
not as the hypocrites, of sad countenance:
for they disfigure their faces, that they
may appear unto men to fast. Verily I
say unto you they have their reward.
But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine
head and wash thy face, that thou appear
not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
which is in secret; and thy Father which
seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The essence of religion is love; some
signs of which have been enumerated
above. The love of God may be of two
kinds. Some love him for his bounties,
others for his perfect beauty irrespective
of bounties. The former love increases
according to the bounties received, but
the latter love is the direct result of the
contemplation of his perfect attributes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
and is constant even in tribulations. “These
are His favoured few,” says Junaid of
Baghdad.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But there are many who pose
as his lovers and with much talk of his
love lack the signs of true love. They
are deluded by the devil, slaves of their
passions, seeking a hollow reputation,
shameless hypocrites who try to deceive
the omniscient Lord their creator. They
are all enemies of God, whether they are
revered as divines or Sufis. Sahl of Taster
who used to address everyone as “Friend”,
was once asked by a person the reason of
his doing so, as all men could not be his
friends. Sahl whispered in his ear saying:
“He will either be a believer or a hypocrite;
if he is a believer, he is God’s friend; if a
hypocrite, the devil’s friend.”</p>

<p>Abu Turab Nakshabi has composed
some verses describing the signs of love.
Their translation is as follows:</p>

<p>Do not profess your love. Hearken to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
me: These are the signs of his love. The
bitterness of tribulations is sweet to him,
he is happy for he believes that everything
proceeds from him; for praise or censure
he cares not, the will of his beloved is his
will. While his heart is burning with love
his countenance is radiant with joy. He
guards the secret of love with all his
might, and no thought save of his beloved
enters into his mind. Yahya bin Maaz
Razi<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> adds some lines: “Another sign is
that he is up and ready like a diver at
the bank of a river; He sighs and sheds
tears in the gloom of night, and day and
night he appears as if fighting for the
sacred cause of his love. He entrusts his
whole self to his love and gladly acquiescing
abides in his love.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="RIZA_OR_JOYOUS_SUBMISSION_TO_HIS_WILL">“RIZA” OR JOYOUS SUBMISSION TO HIS WILL<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></h2>

</div>

<p>Riza is the quintessence of love and is
one of the highest stages of the favoured
few. But some doubt its existence, saying,
How can man be joyous for what is against
his own will. He may submit to God’s
will, but it does not follow that he also
shares the feeling of joy. We shall discuss
the nature of Riza and prove its
existence.</p>

<p>Let us first turn to the Quran and the
Hadis. “Allah has promised to the believing
man and the believing women gardens,
beneath which rivers flow, to abide in
them, and goodly dwellings in gardens of
perpetual abode and best of all is Allah’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
goodly pleasure—that is the grand achievement”.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
In this passage God’s pleasure
(Rizwan) is described as best of all blessings.
In another passage this blessing is
also bestowed on those who joyfully submit
to his will, “Allah is well pleased with
them and they are well pleased with him;
that is for him who fears his Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> “Who
fear the beneficent God in secret and
come with a penitent heart, enter it in
peace that is the day of abiding. They
have therein what they wish <i>and
with us is more yet</i>.” Some commentators
while commenting on the words in italics
say that three gifts will be given in paradise:
(i) a rare gift of which “no soul knows
(in this world) what is hidden for them of
that which will refresh the eyes”.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> (ii) The
salutation as mentioned in the Quran:
“Peace (Salam) a word from the merciful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Lord”.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> (iii) His goodly grace and pleasure
as mentioned in “wa Rizwanumminallahi
akbar” (and best of all is Allah’s goodly
pleasure).</p>

<p>The Prophet once asked some of his
companions to point out the signs of the
faith which they professed. “O apostle
of God,” said the companions, “we are
patient in tribulations, grateful in felicity
and pleased with what is ordained”. “Ye
are Muslims” said the Prophet. Again
the Prophet said: “Ye who are poor be
pleased with what God has put you in and
then you shall have your reward”.</p>

<p>Let us discuss the nature of Riza.
Those who deny the existence of Riza, saying
that man can be patient in sufferings
but joyous submission to His will is not possible,
really deny the existence of love and
its all-absorbing nature. A lover always
loves his beloved’s actions. Now this love
of actions is of two kinds: (1) Redemption
from the experience of pain caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
in mental or physical suffering.</p>

<p>Experience shows that many warriors
while enraged do not feel the pain of their
wounds, and know it only when they see
blood gushing from them. Even when
a man is engaged in some action which
absorbs his attention, the pain of a thorn
pricking him will not be felt. If then in
such cases—and there are many such—pain
is not felt, will it not be possible that a
devotee who is absorbed in him does not
feel pain, which in his belief is inflicted by
his beloved?</p>

<p>Or (2) although pain is felt, he would
desire it just as a patient who feels the pain
caused by the surgeon’s lancet is glad to be
operated upon and is pleased with the
surgeon’s action. Similarly he who firmly
believes that tribulations are like God-sent
curatives will be pleased with them and be
thankful to God. Anyone who ponders
over the nature of the above mentioned
kinds and then in the light of them
reads the lives and the sayings of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
lovers of God, will, I believe, be convinced
of the existence of Riza.</p>

<p>Saint Basher, son of Harith, narrates
the story: In the Sharkia Lane of Baghdad,
I saw a man who received a thousand
stripes, but did not cry in his agony. He
was then sent to prison and I followed
him. “Why have you been punished so
mercilessly?” I asked. “Because they have
found out the secret of my love”. “But
why were you so strangely quiet while you
were punished so severely”, I asked in
astonishment. “Because”, answered the
poor fellow with a sigh, “She was looking
at me from her balcony”. “Oh that you
might see the true Beloved”, I murmured.
Hearing this, his colour at once changed,
and with a loud cry he fell dead.</p>

<p>The same saint tells another story:
“While I was a student of Sufiism I
went to Jazirai Abbadan,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> where I saw a
blind epileptic leper, lying on the ground
while worms were eating his flesh. I sat by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
his side and placed his head on my lap and
spoke gently to him. When he came to
his senses, he spoke: ‘Who is this stranger
who comes between me and my Lord.
Even if each and every limb is severed
from my body, I will love Him.’ That scene
of Riza, says the saint, I shall never
forget; it is a life-long lesson for me.”</p>

<p>It is said that Christ once saw a blind
forlorn leper who was praying: “Blessed
art thou, O Lord, who hast saved me from
such maladies which have overtaken
many of us”. “Art thou not in misery”
asked Christ, “Tell me which is that
malady which has not overtaken thee”.
“Thank God”, cried the leper, “I am not
like him who does not know God”. “You
are right”, said Christ, “Give me your
hand”. And the breath of Christ instantly
healed the leper, and he became one of
his followers.</p>

<p>The Prophet’s companion Said bin
Wakas,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> lost his eyesight in old age, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
resigning his post returned to Mecca. People
flocked to him for blessing as he was
known to be one whose prayers were always
heard. Says Abdullah bin Said: “I was
then a mere boy; I too went to pay my
respects to the venerable Said. He spake
kindly to me and blessed me. Then I said:
‘Uncle, how is it that you who are praying
for everybody would not pray for the
restoration of your eyesight?’ ‘My son’,
answered Said with a smile, ‘to be
pleased with His sweet will is better than
eyesight’”.</p>

<p>Some people went to see Shibli<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> at
Maristan, where he was imprisoned. “Who
are you?” asked the saint. “Friends”, they
all replied with one voice. Hearing this
Shibli fetched some stones and began to
throw them at them, and they all fled
calling him a madman. “What’s this”,
exclaimed Shibli, “You call yourselves my
friends but if you are sincere, bear
patiently what ye receive from me,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
then he sang: “His love has turned my
brain. Have you ever seen a lover who
is not intoxicated with love!”</p>

<p>These narratives point out that Riza
or joyous submission to God’s will is
possible and is one of the highest stages to
which the souls of true devotees could
aspire. People believe in eccentricities of
Cupid’s votaries but give no ear to the
ecstasies of the true lovers of God. Perhaps
they have no eyes to look at the
manifestation of His beauty; no ears to
listen to the music of His love, no heart
to gaze at and enjoy His sweet presence.
Perhaps they are proud of their learning
and think too much of their good deeds
but they have no idea of humble and
broken hearts.</p>

<p>A certain nobleman of Bustam, comely
in appearance and lordly in bearing, used
to attend the sermons of saint Bayazid of
Bustam.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> One day he said to the saint:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
“For thirty years I have been keeping
fasts waking for the whole night and offering
my prayers, but still I do not find in
me the animating force of what you teach,
although I believe in it and cherish love
for you.” “Thirty years”: ejaculated the
saint: “Why for three hundred years if
you do as you have done till now you will
not have a bit of it.” “How is that?”
asked the astonished nobleman. “Because”
answered the saint “the veil of your egotism
has fallen heavily on your mind’s eye”.
The chief then asked the saint to tell him
of some remedy, but he declined saying
that the chief would not like to take it.
“But do tell me”, entreated the nobleman,
“And I will try my best to follow your kind
advice”. “Listen then”, calmly answered
the saint, “This very moment go to
the barber, get your head and beard shaven,
take off this apparel, and gird your loins
with a piece of blanket; gather children
round you and tell them that whosoever
gives you a slap with the hand will get a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
walnut; pass through the throngs in all
the bazars, followed by those children and
then show yourself to your intimate
friends”.</p>

<p>“Subhan Allah” exclaimed the chief,
“Do you say that to me”. “Hold thy
tongue”, retorted the saint, “thy Subhan
Allah is blasphemy.” “How is that”,
asked the chief. “Because,” replied the
saint, “you uttered Subhan Allah not for
any reverence for the Holy Being but out
of respect for your own vain self”. “Well”,
said the chief, “tell me some other remedy,
please”. “Try this remedy first”, continued
the saint. “I cannot do so,” rejoined the
chief. “There you are”, spoke the saint
finally, “Did I not tell you that you would
not like the remedy.”</p>

<p>Our egoistic tendencies impede the
progress of our souls towards higher virtues,
and hence some of us go the length of denying
the possibility of their existence. Let
the lives of the true lovers of God be our
guide.</p>

Al Ghazzali’s works were so widely studied that it is hardly
possible to suppose that Maimonides was not influenced by
them. The influence may have been direct, as Maimonides
was not only a student in Spain but also physician in the
court of Saladin in Alexandria. Indirectly the influence may
have come through the Jewish poet Yehuda Halevi.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> It is interesting to note here the following passage from
a modern European author: “If we form a conception of a
Perfect or Infinite Mind it is in this sense that we must speak
of such a mind as free. To speak of choice between alternatives
is to suggest that another than the best might be chosen
and this would be inconsistent with the idea of perfection.</p>

<p>A finite mind, limited in knowledge and power and
distracted by desires other than the will to goodness, may yet
have a partial measure of self-determination which is complete
only in the infinite. It is incompletely determined by forces
external to itself. And if it stand—as it does stand—between
the realm of nature and the realm of goodness, conscious of
the good and yet beset by many temptations to fall to a lower
level, then the relative independence or partial spontaneity
of such a mind may be exhibited in the power to direct its
own path toward the goal of goodness or to allow it to lapse
into evil. Its freedom will be neither complete independence
of external determination nor complete agreement with the
ideal of goodness; but it will exclude total subordination to
the forces beyond itself, and it will give opportunity for
choosing and serving the good. In spite of its restrictions
human activity will be recognized as possessing a core of
spontaneity”. W. R. Sorley: <i>Moral Values and the Idea of
God</i>. Cambridge 1918 pp. 446-7.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> <i>Quran</i> VIII. 17. This passage refers to the battle of
Badr, the first battle of the Prophet. The Muslims slew the
enemy but it is affirmed that really they did not slay, but it
was Allah who slew them; the meaning apparently being
that Allah’s hand was working in the battle, which is also
clear from the fact that three hundred Muslims mostly raw
and equipped with neither horses nor sufficient arms, prevailed
against a thousand of the most renowned warriors who
had come to crush the growing power of Islam. “And
Thou didst not smite when thou didst smite”. Ghazzali
points out that negation and affirmation for one and the same
action throw new light on the nature of causation. Negation
affirms God as the efficient and real cause; affirmation establishes
man’s free-will faithfully executing divine order.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> <i>Quran</i> XCV. 4-6. Whether man is by nature good or
bad is a question which has vexed great thinkers from
ancient times. Various answers have been suggested, which
are summed up in three distinct theories:</p>

<p>1. Evil is innate. Education simply muzzles the brute in
man. Civilisation is mere veneering process. This cynical view
of human nature is the religion of despair.</p>

<p>2. Man is neither good nor bad. Mind is a <i>tabula rasa</i>.
Good or bad actions leave their impression. Thorns and roses
are alike gathered by it.</p>

<p>3. Good and evil are mixed up in man. He has an angelic
as well as a satanic nature. The development of this double
nature depends on the force of external circumstances and
surrounding influences. Good and evil are like two seeds:
whichever is sown and taken care of will grow into a tree.</p>

<p>The Quranic expression: “we created man in the best
make” emphasises the purity of his nature. He is born with
good and for good, but has to preserve and to develop his
goodness to his full capacity in the struggle of life. He has but
one seed which is good if it grows and bears fruit it is
called goodness; if it be crushed or nipped in the bud it is
called evil. Evil, therefore has no separate entity in him, it is
simply a negative which will lose his soul and reduce him
to the lower depths.</p>

called by Cardinal Newman “eccentricities of the saints.”
He is aware of their liability to abuse and points out their
error in a manner which six hundred years later took the
form of Bishop Butler’s dictum that reason cannot abdicate
its right of judging obvious improprieties in religious doctrines
and persons. “Ibn Allah”, (Son of God) refers to the
orthodox Christian view of Jesus. “Anal Haq” (I am the
truth, i.e. God) refers to the expression of Husain bin Mansur
al Hallaj, who in 309 A.D. was crucified in Bagdad for his
blasphemy. The poet Hafiz says of him: “Jurmash an bud
ki asrar huwaida bikard.” (His crime was that he revealed
the secrets.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">[72]</a> Compare <i>Quran</i> XXIV. 35. “Allah is the light of the
heavens and the earth: a likeness of his light is a pillar on
which is a lamp, the lamp is in a glass (and) the glass is as
it were a brightly shining star lit from a blessed olive tree,
neither eastern nor western, the oil whereof almost gives
light though fire touches it not (heads daffor.) Allah guides to
his light whom he pleases, and Allah sets forth parables for
men and Allah is cogniscant of all things.” Al Ghazzali has
written a separate treatise called <i>Mishkat ul Anwar</i> dealing
exhaustively with the above passage. An excellent summary
of his views is given by Razi in his Commentary, vol. VI. 393-408.
(Stamboul edition). In the above parable Islam is represented
as a likeness of the divine light, a light placed high on
a pillar so as to illumine the whole world, a light guarded by
being placed in a glass so that no puff of wind can put it
out, a light so resplendent that the glass itself in which it is
placed is as a brilliant star. Just as a fig tree stands for a
symbol of Judaism (see <i>St. Matthew</i> XXI. 19) the olive stands
for Islam, which must give light to both the East and the
West, and does not specifically belong to either one of them.</p>

effaced from self, so that he is conscious neither of his body
nor of outward things, nor of inward feelings. He is rapt
from all these, journeying first to his Lord and then in his
